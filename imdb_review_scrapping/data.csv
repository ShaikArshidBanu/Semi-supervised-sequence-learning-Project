0,The story is really engaging. It didn't feel like 2.5 hours! I enjoyed every second of it. I like the bond between Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux. The ending got me tearful. Who would have thought James Bond would make someone cry?
1,"It is clear right from the beginning that ""No Time to Die"" has a plan. That alone makes it better than half the Bond films ever made. Unfortunately, despite being fairly entertaining overall, Daniel Craig's swan song in the role is filled with lofty ideals undercut by horrible execution.For a very basic overview, ""No Time to Die"" sees Bond (Craig) seemingly enjoying a post-007 life with Madeline Swan (Lea Seydoux). Of course, as so often happens, things go awry and the lovers are pulled back into the espionage game, largely courteous of the enigmatic Lyutsifer Safin (Remi Malek) and a viral terrorism scheme.I'll begin with what this movie does well, as it does possess some redeeming qualities for sure:-Craig remains a great Bond. That hasn't changed since we first saw him in 2006.-Ana de Armas is one of the best ""Bond girls"" (to use that phrase loosely) in the history of the franchise. Her character is a shot in the arm midway through the film.-Because this was Craig's confirmed last don of the tuxedo, director Cary Joji
Fukunaga was able to arc the plot lines to a resolute climax. Absolutely no indecision on that front.-In typical franchise fashion, it provides enough thrills and spectacle to be watchable. You won't be nodding off or anything like that. Truth be told, while walking out of the theater this was more of a 7-star effort.After some further cogitation, however, it is fairly obvious that ""No Time To Die"" suffers from some pretty serious faults, all centered upon this premise: great ideas, horrible execution of them.Some examples:-The opening villain scene? Tremendous--one of the best Bond opens ever. The villain is then hardly referenced at all for close to an hour (if not longer).-Having James Bond fall in love with a woman instead of objectifying/using one is interesting--but not enough time is spent on that topic and I'm not sure if Seydoux (or her character writing) is up to that dramatic task.-Teasing a black, female 00 agent? Again, could have been something really meaningful but instead used only as a wink-and-nod to the camera.-Bond--the most famous big screen womanizer of all-time--as a girl Dad? Very intriguing--so of course utterly ruined by the filmmakers initially telling viewers point-blank ""she isn't Bond's daughter"", and then at the end saying ""oh yeah--she actually was Bond's daughter all along"". Embarrassingly plotted in that sense.-As previously mentioned, de Armas was the best part of this film (at least for me). The epitome of incredible beauty but also precipitating the best action sequence in all of ""No Time to Die"". Predictably, following the pattern here, she appears for maybe 15-20 minutes and is never seen again. Head-scratching.For a film that clocks in at a bloated two hours and 40 minutes, it is a little hard to believe that all the above great concepts were still given short shrift. But that is exactly what happens in ""No Time to Die"". It spends all its time introducing these little nuggets, but none actually following through on them in a compelling way.So, while it was certainly nice to have a big movie spectacle back in theaters as the world claws out of a pandemic, those are the circumstances for which I'll likely remember ""No Time to Die"". It certainly won't be for its tight plots or well-developed characters."
2,"NO TIME TO DIE (2021) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, Billy Magnussen, Christsoph Waltz, David Dencik, Ana de Armas, Dali Benssalah. Craig's swan song as 007 delivers all the goods with his brute force tactics and surprising vulnerability are on tap when his services are requested after 5 years retirement to stop baddie Lyutsifer Safin (silky Malek) from infiltrating a deadly nanobot virus via DNA into the world populace while also nursing his love for Seydoux who is in the mix in oh so many ways. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (who collaborated on the screenplay with Nal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) infuses death-defying set pieces with visual flair to spare (best viewed in Imax) as well as some much needed dry wit and humor."
3,"The first 20-25 minutes are superb (from the music to the location to the acting to the action), but then the titles fall (cool titles, bland song), and the movie never quite reaches those heights again. For such a long, bloated running time it's too talky and surprisingly short on action; in fact, there are only two other notable set-pieces, the car chase in the woods and Ana de Armas brightening up the screen as an overeager, bubbly yet skilled and deadly agent. Most of the rest of the action is uninspired, and in the climactic sequence (just a regular attack-on-the-enemy-fortress we've seen hundreds of times) often dim and murky (Tomorrow Never Dies did this sort of thing much better, and so did some of the Roger Moore Bonds). The plot is formulaic (biological weapon....again), and its treatment of several key players from previous installments disappointing. The ending is pretty silly - it leaves a mess behind that the (inevitable) next chapter will either have to work a whale of a story to get around or (more likely) will ignore altogether. Craig does succeed at embodying a very human Bond, yet I can't help but think that he never really got the chance to do a FUN James Bond living the high life: in Casino he is earning his stripes, in Quantum he is seeking vengeance, in Skyfall he is already tired and resigned, in No Time his circle comes to an end. I guess he came closest to having a good time in Spectre, which is why that film is still my favorite of the five he made. **1/2 out of 4."
4,"It felt as though we were never going to get to see this, but finally it's here, the question is, was it worth the wait?The answer, yes, really not what I was expecting, of course it's action packed, dramatic and high octane, but it actually boasts a good story, and perhaps shows us a slightly different side to the character.I thought Daniel Craig was awesome, and I'm sad that he's leaving, it's fascinating now to know who'll take over.On the downside, it was long, it was way too long, it did lull a little in parts, but the action was enough to halt any dozing.Overall, very watchable, 8/10."
5,"Director Antoine Fuqua also did his best with the screenplay he had, and created the perfect amount of non-stop tension and suspense - also due to Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance. The cinematography and score were also on point, and the 90 min runtime and pacing just right. But the story itself was just nothing spectacular and easily forgettable - and written better in other 911 films. There were also too many plot and technical issues, and unrealistic actions and procedures taken by both the police and 911 operators. It's a generous 7/10 from me."
6,"""The Guilty"" is a remake of a Danish film of the same name. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Riley Keogh, and Peter Saarsgard.I didn't see the Danish film, so I have to go by what I saw in this film.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Joe, a 911 operator who seems to be in a bad mood. He's asthmatic, he has occasionally loud ringing in his ears, and as time goes on, we learn his story. He is not with his wife and misses his little girl. He is a police officer on 911 duty pending a hearing. We know federal officers have been to the home of his ex-partner. We find out more details at the end of the film.Joe receives a call from a woman, Emily (Keogh - Elvis' granddaughter) and from the phone call, Joe discerns that she has been abducted, possibly by her husband - this all comes out gradually.The city is in the midst of the California wildfires, so a lot of calls go back and forth as a very tense and involvedJoe tries to get someone to look for her - even though he doesn't have enough information.He also talks to Emily's daughter Abby, who is alone with her brother Oliver. He sends the police there, and when they arrive, they see that the baby, Oliver, has been hurt, and Abby has blood all over her.Thanks to the technology, Joe is able to come up with the address of Emily's husband - he wants someone to go over there and break down the door and look for info as to where he's taken Emily. Joe is clearly unhinged by this situation, going deeper and deeper into an abyss, with a court case pending and his own home situation affecting his emotional state.This film is a tour de force for Jake Gyllenhaal, who again proves what a magnificent talent he is. The tension in ""The Guilty"" is enough to send you climbing the walls, and it's his show all the way. Keogh and Saarsgard (Gyllenhaal's real-life brother in-law) are the voices of Emily and her husband Henry, and they give knockout performances. However, we never see them.Because of the emotion and anger Joe puts into this case, he finally realizes that he needs to make an important decision if he is ever to heal from his own drama.I won't say anymore, except that some people should not be 911 operators (I'm one of them). Joe doesn't have the necessary detachment.I'm sure the original was great, but I do also believe it's possible for an American remake to shine. This one did, thanks to a powerful performance.And by the way, due to COVID, the director directed the entire film from a van and was not on the soundstage."
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's start with this disclosure: the original Danish film from Gustav Moller was one of my top 5 favorite films of 2018. Even then, I fully expected an Americanized version to happen at some point. The surprise is having director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY, 2001) handle the remake. He's known more for bombast and action, than the nuanced suspense delivered by the original. To offset this, Mr. Fuqua wisely chose the dependable Jake Gyllenhaal as his lead, and the talented Nic Pizzolatto (creator and lead writer of HBO's ""True Detective"") to adapt the screenplay.Gyllenhaal never cheats the audience, and he dives into the role with his typical full force commitment. Except for a few blurry visuals of cars on the highway and the dramatic opening shots of the raging California fires, Gyllenhaal's Joe Baylor is on screen for the entire run. He's a detective on desk duty at the 911 call center pending his court case on charges that only become clear towards the end. Joe is also separated from his wife and daughter; a crucial element in how his shift plays out in front of us.As we listen in on his first few calls, it becomes obvious how Joe's time on the streets have fine-tuned his quick-to-judge persona. He's not shy about telling callers their own choices are responsible for their current predicament. Just as he's about to dismiss his latest caller Emily, his instincts kick in, and he discerns that she's been abducted by her husband in a white van, and fears for her safety. This initial call between Joe and Emily is a work of art, and kicks off the nearly unbearable tension for the rest of the movie and Joe's shift.Fuqua and Pizzolatto infuse commentary unique to modern day America. The fires are always in the background impacting emergency resources, as well as the air being breathed. Police collusion and abuse of power are also an underlying aspect of what unfolds in front of us. Yet somehow, the film (perhaps accidentally) speaks to the immense pressure faced by law enforcement and how instincts and quick judgments are crucial to assistance and survival. Joe bounces from calm demeanor to explosive overreaction in the blink of an eye - or the beep of an incoming call. We witness how preconceived notions can lead one astray, even if they've worked in the past.In addition to Gyllenhaal's commendable performance, the film includes terrific voice work (via phone) from such actors as Riley Keough (as Emily), Peter Sarsgaard, Ethan Hawke, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Christiana Montoya, and Paul Dano. Adrian Martinez and Christina Vidal appear alongside Gyllenhaal in the call center, although the single setting contributes to this being mostly a one-man show.We understand that Joe Baylor is seeking personal redemption in his all-out pursuit to save Emily, and one line in the film speaks directly to this: ""Broken people save broken people."" If you haven't seen the original, you are likely to get caught up in the tension, and ask yourself many of the same questions Joe is asking himself at the end. Gyllenhaal previously teamed with director Fuqua in SOUTHPAW (2015), but this crime thriller is something different for both. If you are up to the challenge, watch this version and the original, so that you can compare the contrasting approaches.Streaming on Netflix beginning October 1, 2021."
8,"My first thoughts after watching The Guilty is this was definitely made during lockdown because of the lack of people on show , but the problem is , after eighteen months of Covid restrictions, a film that as isolated and claustrophobic as this , is the last thing I want to see.The film takes place over the course of a single morning in a 911 dispatch call center. Call operator Joe Baylor (Gyllenhaal) tries to save a caller in grave danger-but he soon discovers that nothing is as it seems, and facing the truth is the only way out.There is no doubting Jake Gyllenhael's acting ability but I have to say this is the first time I've ever thought he's over acting . It doesn't help that his character is unlikable and always angry which only added to my frustration in watching him .It's amazing how a renowned director like Antoine Fuqua who made one of the greatest films ever made in Training day can produce a film that feels as rushed as this , but I suppose you can't always make masterpieces and that's probably the reason this is found on Netflix and not on cinema released.The original 2018 Danish film of the same name is much , much better .Disappointing."
9,30 minutes in and you realize that you do not care about either the main character or the problem he is trying to solve. Jake does his best but that is not enough.
10,"I have been watching gangster movies for over 40 years and I know a good one when I see one. This one aint bad, but it is unfortunately another wannabe gangster movie...The bad: it has all the looks and gestures of a gangster movie, but what is lacking is COHONES. This movie is lacking in real butch, macho, tough gangsters. INot terribly bad, but definitely not ringing my bells either."
11,"THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK (2021) *** Alessandro Nivola, Leslie Odom, Jr., Vera Farmiga, Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, Ray Liotta, Michela De Rossi, Michael Gandolfini, Billy Magnussen, John Magaro, (voice of Michael Imperioli) Big-screen prequel to the iconic HBO drama TV series THE SOPRANOS looks at the origin story of mob boss Tony Soprano and his 'famiglia' set against the backdrop of the race riots of 1967 thru the '70s. Show creator David Chase's screenplay with veteran series director Alan Taylor transplants the small screen's largesse successfully for the most part with a fine ensemble and a casting coup of the late, great James Gandolfini's real-life lookalike son Michael as the teenage Tony."
12,"The main question that first arises when attempting to review David Chase's Sopranos prequel is whether it can stand on its own without pre-knowledge of the original series. The answer is decidedly no. The Many Saints of Newark is strictly designed as a tribute to the HBO series and you cannot really appreciate it without having some knowledge of the beloved original.So let's judge it on those terms. One notes right away that ""Many Saints"" has a meandering plot-what looks like a series of disparate episodes haphazardly strung together. The worst plot offender is the tangential story about how the 1967 Newark riots relate to Chase's origin exploration of the DiMeo crime family.Too much time is devoted in the early part of the picture to developing this subplot. The riots are mainly introduced as a pretext for the main character in the film, Uncle ""Dickie"" Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola) to find a way of disposing the body of his father, ""Hollywood Dick"" Moltisanti (Ray Liotta), whom he has just murdered in the usual Sopranos ""fit of rage"" (Dickie drags his dad to a drainage supply building where the riots are taking place and burns it down to make it look like his father was a victim of the escalating violence in the neighborhood).Indeed it's these ""over-the-top"" moments of violence that Sopranos' fans live for. Usually this involves a completely inappropriate response to a small slight that sets these mobsters off and into a frenzy. In addition to Dickie murdering his father, he also murders his stepmother Giueppina Moltisanti (Michela de Rossi) by drowning her at the beach while on a vacation after she confesses to having an affair with Harold McBrayer (Leslie Odom Jr.), the African-American Newark resident and one of Dickie's workers who ends up starting his own numbers racket in opposition to Dickie's operation.The film ends with another one of these typical Sopranos' explosions of violence. This time Dickie is the one who meets his maker not at the hands of the usual suspects-the fledgling African-American gang now muscling in on the Dimeo crime family's territory-but by Uncle Junior (Corey Stoll) himself, another ""victim"" of one of those absurd slights (Junior felt humiliated when Dickie laughed at him after falling down on church steps hurting his back).Nivola has the best role here as Uncle Dickie, a stand-in for the older Tony Soprano from the original TV series. Chase attempts to humanize the character by depicting his generous side (he attempts to make amends after murdering his father by doing good deeds such as sponsoring a baseball team for blind kids).One must appreciate the performance of Michael Gandolfini, son of the late James Gandolfini who played the adult Tony Soprano. As the young Tony, Michael not only looks like his father but manages to capture his mannerisms. The idea is to show Michael as a teenager before he commits to a life of violence-we see signs of his future misconduct in his commission of misdemeanors such as stealing the answers to a geometry test at school.Despite Chase's accurate vision of the teenage Michael, not enough happens with him of much consequence. His best moments occur when he interacts with his mother Livia (Vera Farmiga), who does a great job in conveying how she contributed to Tony's eventual decision to embrace a life of violence and amorality.The depictions of the rest of the main Soprano characters in their early incarnations prove to be a mixed bag. I don't see much being done with Johnny Soprano (Tony's father) who is released after four years in prison along with Paulie Walnuts (so colorful in the original series but totally insignificant here) along with Silvio, the devoted confederate (a mere caricature this time around).Better is Stoll as Uncle Junior and Liotta in a dual role of Hollywood Dick and his twin brother Sally, the wise convict who gives Dickie good advice, despite being incarcerated in the penitentiary for life.The best Sopranos' episodes kept you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Here there are only flashes of brilliance with little organic connection between one plot point and another. I also found it a bit disappointing that the Harold character gets away with the pain he inflicts on the DiMeo family. In the original series the gang would have found a way to retaliate to maximum effect.The Many Saints of Newark is a decent enough tribute to the original TV series and has its bright moments. But not all the characters are drawn cleverly enough to prompt us to heap accolades upon it ad infinitum."
13,"Remember when ""The Sopranos"" took the television show to new narrative heights? Remember when each new episode was more anxiously awaited than any new movie? Remember when you wished more movies could be told as TV series or miniseries on HBO or Showtime, so that they could go into more detail, take their time developing.It is ironic that the show that surpassed film would then go back to that form, and all the more ironic that the resultant film doesn't hold a candle to the TV show. We hung on every moment of ""Sopranos"". People watch and rewatch scenes noticing tell-tale placement of actors in similar positions to where the actors were in prior scenes. They go over dialogue, building profiles of characters who never even appear on the show, but we get to know them better than most on-screen characters in other shows.The legendary Dickie Moltisanti was oft mentioned in the show, and here we finally get to see him, played by one of few Italian-American actors who aren't famous for mob roles, Alessandro Nivola. For such a revered figure, he turns out to be a dead end, not emerging with any discernible personality. That should be okay though, because of course this movie shows us younger versions we all know and oddly love, such as Silvio Dante, Paulie Walnuts, Uncle Junior. Except - wait a minute. None of them say or do anything interesting here. The guy who plays Silvio particularly just seems to be trying as hard as he can to ape Steve Van Zandt. You can never take him seriously as the character. And how is Billy Magnussen's Paulie Walnuts so boring? He stole every scene on ""The Sopranos"". Here he does nothing.""The Sopranos"". So many great lines. So many great scenes. You can watch YouTubes of them for hours without getting bored. ""The Many Saints of Newark"" barely captured my interest at all."
14,"The film follows the Sopranos starting in the late 60's. We watch the major influences on the life of Tony during the racial tension of Newark.Having not seen the series, I am sure I missed some nuances. It was an interesting crime family film.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Michela De Rossi)"
15,"Eddie Brock gets a chance to interview Cletes Kasady (Woody Harrelson) abused as a child and serial killer as an adult. In looking at the graffiti on his cell walls, Venom is able to figure out where the bodies are buried. The death penalty is reinstated as Cletus head for lethal injection. Cletus also has a love interest in Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) aka ""the shriek: because of her high pitch deadly voice. On Brock's final visit to Cletus, he infects the serial killer with a piece of Venom which turn him into Carnage who goes on a rampage of revenge.I didn't like this as much as the first film. The climax fight scene had multiple sides and lasted an inane amount of time with equally inane action. I guess this is what audiences' want. I liked seeing Woody not acting old. I thought someone like Octavia Spencer would have made an interesting Francis Barrison.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity unless you notice that Venom doesn't wear pants."
16,"Venom: Let there be Carnage (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw last week in theatres. The movie focuses on serial killer Cletus Cassidy and his rough upbringing. When Eddie Brock is chosen to be his reporter, and Cassidy takes a bite of him, the symbiote suit on Brock breaks off and infects Cassidy creating a ruthless killer like never seen before. Can Brock and Venom stay on the same page long enough to bring him down? This movie is directed by Andy Serkis (Heavenly Sword) and stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killer), Naomi Harris (28 Days Later), Michelle Williams (Blue Valentine) and Stephen Graham (Snatch). The storyline for this is very compelling and is well written from a plot to character standpoint. The dialogue is first rate and hilarious as are the special effects, which are fantastic. The CGI fits the comics to perfection. The action scenes from beginning to end are wondeful; my one complaint, this is the darkest and most violent and gruesome Marvel comic series, and every kill and gore sequence is hidden by random things like cut away scenes or random tornados 🌪 to hide what are gruesome kills in the comic. The dialogue makes up for it but the lack of showing the kills keeps this from being the masterpiece it had the potential to be. This is a worthwhile sequel I would score a 7.5/10."
17,"When we got to the climax and it felt like the movie just breezed by, I immediately added another star to my rating. A short super(anti)hero movie? AMAZING!Venom: Let There Be Carnage isn't a great movie and has ALL the clichés of most superhero movies, but it was enjoyable. I found myself laughing a lot at Venom's one-liners and again, I enjoyed how SWIFT this movie was. That was refreshing.Despite some exposition, this is one of those sequels YOU MUST see the first one to understand this universe. And that's too bad. I rated the first one 2/5 stars and didn't care for it much. This is absolutely the better of the two.Eddie Brock & Co. - or the alien symbiote, Venom - are still fighting over superiority when they have a break-up. Simultaneously, the guy who used to bartend at Cheers turns into both a supervillain and Venom's greatest foe. Will Eddie make up with Venom in time to stop the Carnage?Yes, this movie has the age-old Superhero trope I hate so dearly: ""I don't wanna be a superhero anymore! I quit!"" usually found in the second chapter. Superman II did it, The Dark Knight did it, Iron Man 2 did it, hell, Spider-Man 2 did it, just to name a few of hundreds of examples. I hate it with a passion. So, when it happened here, I tried to remain calm. Mercifully, when Venom's on his own, he does have some fantastic and hilarious scenes. This one gets a pass because we hardly ever get to see the other side of this equation. All we usually get is the whiney non-superhero.That and some of the lazy writing's are probably the most problems of this. Everything else was fine or actually good. No one was terrible and the special effects were 10x better than the original. Recommended.***Final Thoughts: My friend with me said: We have to wait for the mid-credit scene. The second he told me that, I knew 100% who was showing up. Despite that, listen to my friend. You need to see it."

19,"5/10 - god awful editing/pacing and such a weak story that I'm surprised Sony okayed it, Venom: Let There Be Carnage's only highlights are the plethora of aggressive visuals and its supporting cast."
20,"The visuals are pretty impressive. Even though the colour palette is monotonous, the visuals are beautiful and captivating. The story is ending, albeit slow at times. I really like Timothee Chamalet's character. Overall, I liked it."
21,"Dune is a new film adaptation of Frank Herbert's book. This film adaptation is directed in part written and produced by Denis Villeneuve, the director of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049.Set in the distant future, the film is about Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the future heir to the house of Atreides. His family trades in the valuable commodity called spice, which they get from the dangerous desert planet Arrakis. Other houses try to take control of spice themselves with a hostile takeover so that they get a monopoly over here. Paul must try to stop these houses, but isn't sure if he can use the help of the local full of Arrakis.Frank Herbert's science fiction book has already been filmed in 1984 and later in 2000 there was also a short TV series of the same book. These film adaptations were not a success. As a fan of the book, director Denis Villeneuve is now trying to film the story in a dignified way. Despite the fact that Denis Villeneuve and the other screenwriters try to convey the story in a clear way, it can still seem a bit unclear to people who are not familiar with Frank Herbert's Dune story. For these people, it can seem like they are watching season four of Game of Thrones, for example, without having seen the previous seasons. Hopefully with the planned sequel they can give more clarity to the story of Frank Herbert's book without you having to read it first to understand the film better. If successful, the Dune film series could come across as the new Star Wars film of our time.What Denis Villeneuve has more luck with are the film effects that can be used in movies these days. Together with the visual effects team, he manages to portray the film beautifully and believably. With a good eye for detail, they know how to bring out the different houses with their rituals. Except for the battle over who has control over the spice raw material, you don't know clearly why the different houses attack each other.As the lead character, Timothée Chalamet still seems a bit ignorant, which may be because his character is now allowed to meddle in the affairs of his family's house for the first time. The better acting comes more from the adult film cast like Oscar Issac, Rebecca Ferguson and Josh Brolin. Other cast members also play more smaller roles, some of which don't really have a clear build-up. Cast members like Jason Momoa or Zendaya still play a minor role in this movie, but maybe some of them will get more opportunity and time to develop their characters in the sequel."
22,"Mammoth film, with wonderful settings and music. A special mention must be given to the special effects which are breathtaking. The film, however, has two main problems, the first is its monstrous slowness which makes it really difficult to watch because some scenes could easily be cut without impacting the perception of the film, the second problem is the ending because the latter is missing as this film is only an introduction and for this reason when you leave the theater you feel like you have wasted only time in a film that was absolutely nothing."
23,"I've watched the original David Lynch version of 'Dune' a couple of years ago, well it's a bit far-fetched to say that I've watched it - more like the first 40 minutes after which I got bored and quit the movie. And I have to admit, if I weren't in the theater tonight I would walk out of this one too.The bell rang early on when I saw PART ONE on the movie screen and I thought, great, this is going to be one of those movies that drag along for eternity only to be continued some other time later but was there really anything to continue? What have I learned in this 2,5 hour pilot of the miniseries called Dune? Not much.The characters are paper thin as usual and leave no desire to follow any of them. Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Jason Momoa and even Oscar Isaac are there only because they're tough looking fellas who (surprise surprise!) play some tough looking characters. Rebecca Ferguson's character is plain annoying and doesn't do absolutely anything to move the plot while being a main character. Timothee Chalamet is the only one to provoke any kind of empathy toward a viewer but he wears only one face for the duration of the movie and barely scratches the surface of his own character who is supposed to be deeper than he looks but his performance, along with many others, leaves it all to guessing there could've been more (but wasn't).The whole movie builds a concept to the bigger story but in the end turns out to be just 2,5 hours of running around, changing one desert after another, buried in semi-darkness most of the time and therefore killing most of the great visuals it has, filled with repetitive lines and Hans Zimmer's trademark thundering soundtrack that you easily get tired of by the middle of the movie.After all I don't get why did the people involved think this would be a good idea to remake a mediocre movie from 40 years ago and not do it justice by making it at least better?"
24,It was a good film. Not the second coming of Christ as many procalime it to be but it was intersting and simply perfect eye candy. Denis Villeneuve truely knows how to make a film visually attractive and he is quite in line with Christopher Nolan in that regard. Also his directing style more and more becomes similiar to that of Nolan although he is a little darker.I never saw the origianl and never had the ambition to do so I cant really compare them but I also dont think they were supposed to be compareable as this is a new interpretation of the source novel.Acting wise it was good. I liked Timothee Chalament who made more out of his character than the screenplay offered him to do. Nice character development. Rebecca Ferguson is always good to see in a majro role. She had some really good moments. Zendaya was a bit one note but very pretty on the eyes. Josh Brolin was kind of wasted although he had a very interesting approach for his character. Oscar Isaac and Jason Marmoa were both good. The best of the supporting cast was undoubtly Javier Bardem.I loved the cinematography and the visual effeets are some of the best of the recent years. Technically it was clearly a masterpiece and I dont think anything will beat it in this regard in 2021.
25,"With plot points that are reminiscent of ""The Truman Show"", ""Pleasantville"", ""The Matrix"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Wreck-it Ralph"" , the video game ""Grand Theft Auto"", among others, you might think that this film feels derivative. But the film is so imaginative, so fresh, so creative, that it never feels that way.Ryan Reynolds stars as Guy, a background character in a GTA-styled game who doesn't realize he lives in an unreal world (for a very clever reason that I won't mention here). He meets a player-drive character (played by Jodie Comer) and his life changes. Lil Rel Howery plays Buddy, Guy's best friend.We have seen better displays of CGI, but this film has a plot that complex, yet easy to follow. Creating the film, with its levels of graphics, real action, and effects must have been extraordinarily complicated. It all pays off, because it is so much fun to watch. Repeated viewing will doubtlessly reveal more of the complexity.Reynolds is perfect as the golly-gee innocent who feels stirrings of consciousness. And Comer captures the absurd-yet-believable concept of the real woman who might be falling for an NPC."
26,"'Free Guy (2021)' feels as though it's been made by people who have never actually played a video-game. It's the cinematic equivalent of those pre-rendered mobile game adverts that pretend to present gameplay but don't actually represent the game they're trying to sell at all. Though there are a couple of interesting ideas centred around the A. I. that makes Reynold's Guy able to go against his code, the piece just doesn't do anything with them. It doesn't really make sense and there's no semblance of cohesion or believability to the game that makes up most of its runtime. I mean, who is 'Free City' for and what do you do in it? It's not PvP from the looks of it, but everyone freaks out when an NPC actually presents a challenge to a player. God forbid a player gets killed by an enemy in a game, right? However, the fact that it lacks a proper sense of logic isn't its biggest issue, although it is undeniably irritating that a movie which is supposed to celebrate video-games clearly doesn't understand them and also partakes in the kind of banal 'gamer' stereotyping that perforates pretty much every piece of traditional media about the subject. No, the biggest issue is that, for me, it simply isn't fun. It's quite the opposite, usually. The amount of cringeworthy moments are nearly innumerable and its message is incredibly hypocritical considering that it lambasts big-budget games which are fuelled by mindless chaos and exist only to make money from a target audience that their developers clearly don't respect but it's a big-budget movie which is fuelled by mindless chaos and exists only to make money from a target audience that its creators clearly don't respect. Ryan Reynold's on-screen persona, which is essentially the same in every comedic film in which he appears, is also incredibly annoying and does the opposite of elicit laughter. There are some relatively impressive visual effects - even though nothing feels tangible and one or two are actually rather disturbing - and there are a couple of action sequences which are relatively well put together. However, the overall experience is just dull, despite all of its in-your-face noise. It's just such a corporate attempt, a movie designed by committee. It also has some incredibly disconcerting fan service, the sort that seems to be replacing actual content more and more these days. Sadly, a lot of people seem to be lapping it up. Of course, if you enjoy this film, then good for you; I'm not saying you shouldn't. I'm simply saying I don't. Despite the occasional highlight, it's an uninteresting and uninspired affair overall. 4/10."
27,"I liked the nostalgia and love and effort that was put in Ready Player One, the book. The film was really bad in comparison. And I loved Deadpool, as a satirical middle finger to franchised superhero formulas, but then they did the sequel, because formulaic Deadpool brought money. So when I review Free Guy I am both expressing my satisfaction regarding the seed idea and the disappointment that it never went where it could have gone. Long story short, the film is long, formulaic and only occasionally funny. All the fresh bits were in the trailers and the rest was over the top filler and CGI.I couldn't care less how many celebrity friends come and cameo in your film, nor do I care about the silly faces that you can make if the story is simplistic and most of your movie is video game special effects rendered better. This could have been much more than a real life adaptation of a Lego movie, but you settled!Bottom line: at two hours long, I felt that it lasted forever. It is entertaining, but a requirement to enjoying the film is to turn off your brain completely. Some cameos and hat tips are funny, I give you that, but the concept is already old and tired while the video game references feel from the time Ryan Reynolds spent time on Counter Strike and Second Life and WoW. I will rank this average, but in my heart I know that it is a failure."
28,"I did not expect that, this was chosen literally for convenience, I'd seen the trailers, and didn't think I'd enjoy it, it is so good. I'm sometimes hard to please with films, but this is definitely worth seeing. It's bonkers, it's crazy, but it's funny, and actually pretty moving at times, a more heart warming film then you'd think it would be.Some pretty amazing special effects, it is never boring at any stage.Ryan Reynolds is terrific, and fans if his will appreciate him being here, he's great, as is Comer.I didn't expect it to be this good, 8/10."
29,". . . the extraterrestrial aliens are probably not all well-intentioned candy-munching benign fluff balls, FREE GUY suggests that A. I. entities may NOT have Humanity's best interests and prosperous well-being ingrained as their Prime Objective. Instead, it's more logical to think that any ""Artificial"" Intelligence will be inherently Evil, FREE GUY suggests. This revelation is particularly troubling given the fact that the U. S. Constitution does NOT require America's Presidents to provide any biological proof or test results showing that they actually possess the human genome. After a robotic Algorithm won the popular vote in 2000 (but was denied White House entry due to the confusing Florida butterfly ballot), who's to say that we were not ruled from 2017 until 2021 by a fiendish AI ""businessman non-playable character""? Many of these are seen during FREE GUY (though none of them suggest that people gargle with bleach)."
30,"So finally movies are back in the cinema and this one was one of the first to watch. An Avengers spin-off.It's nice to see how Black Widow was created but after a while it became a bit too much of blah blah but towards the end it do picks up the action again.The effects are stunning and the fight scene's are spectacular too but as said, the story itself has it flows. And maybe some reviews are true, it's more about her sister to be honest.Still a decent Marvel flick but not the best one.Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 5/5
Story 2,5/5
Comedy 0/5."
31,"This comes after the Civil War and before the blink. We get a quick back story of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) quicker than what I had wished. Her entire training is done during the opening credits. I was hoping for more and her conversion etc. We get to meet her pseudo family of Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour who we already met as Alexi. Together they must save the world from Draykov (Ray Winstone) and his legion of Black Widows located world wide.It was not the film I wanted. Florence Pugh stole scenes from Scarlett Johansson, something I did not think possible. She points out the the Black Window always has that three point pose followed by a hair flip. This is what separates Marvel from DC: the dialogue is more entertaining."
32,"I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing. There are a few funny jokes to balance the film too. The scene with Florence Pugh posing made the cinema laughed out loud. I really enjoyed this film."
33,"Shortly after the events of Civil War, Natasha(Johansson, yet again nailing the ""carrying the weight of all the awful things she did before reforming"", which here is made one of the primary themes, along with how found family can help process pain, especially if it is a shared experience) meets back up with the three people (none of whom are actually related by blood) she shared (what little she had of) her childhood with: sister Yelena(Pugh, delivering several, perhaps more than any other one performer, of the many emotional gut punches), mother Melina(Weisz, applying her substantial brains to the situation) and father Alexei(Harbour, both legitimately trying to be parental figures, and occasionally really getting it right), to once and for all accomplish what Romanoff honestly believed she head done decades ago: Kill the evil General Dreykov(Winstone, as usual being deeply compelling as a vicious individual, here a misogynist), and destroy the Red Room, where all Black Widows are broken down, trained, and stripped of any individuality.Obviously, it would have been even better if this had come out years ago. Actually, with a little rewriting, this could easily have come out an entire decade ago. Regardless of any other aspect, the fact that this stars a woman in the titular role has had people saying for years that it would automatically be bad. It's hard to argue that this would have come out upwards of 10 years ago, if not for that one aspect. I think a lot of people would have, and many, I'm sure, did, advise that it not rock the boat any more than that. So it's hard for me to overstate my relief and joy at finding that the movie is unapologetically feminist. It uses the spy training, which includes kidnapping girls when they are children, to explore trauma caused by men against women(obviously, the specifics of what they experience is extremely rare, and the details are hard to relate to. But the notion that some people, if not stopped, are simply going to keep hurting any female they can, really resonates). Ultimately, it could go even further. And it definitely would have been able to go deeper, if not for the trusted MCU formula demanding frequent action scenes. Thankfully, immensely talented director Cate Shortland does what she can (and that's a lot) to keep those scenes as intense and impactful as possible, by keeping the camera close, letting us feel every blow. There are some issues with the pacing and editing, that are most likely down to the movie not being completely done shooting before Corona restrictions were put in place, and a reluctance by the studio to postpone release until those rules were lifted. A decision which, honestly, is completely understandable. I won't spend long talking about Taskmaster, other than to say that, given what they clearly wanted to do there, they should simply have come up with a new character, or picked one that actually suited their needs, since now, they have frustrated(when that wasn't necessary or intentional at all) many who hoped for a more direct interpretation, and now merely distracts from a powerful and carefully thought-out depiction(as far as the ideas that this is exploring, they got it 100-percent spot-on).A little visible blood, and lasting wounds, push the PG-13 rating. I recommend this to any fan of Scarlett, her depiction of the role, of spy thrillers, and of comic book adaptations. 7/10."
34,Black Widow gets a standalone prequel that owes more than a nod to James Bond. There is even a glimpse of Roger Moore in Moonraker.I wonder if Disney were eyeing up a purchase of MGM before Amazon swooped in. It was one way to get their hands on 007.The movie opens in 1995. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) and their daughters Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) suddenly have to leave America.They are Russian sleeper agents and they have been exposed. The family have been working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) and they are not a real family.In 2016 after the events of Civil War. Natasha is on the run. Yelena kills a rogue former Black Widow and comes in contact with a synthetic gas. The frees her from a chemical that controls her mind. She is an operative of Dreykov.Both Natasha and Yelena reunite and then later get together with their surrogate parents. They want to bring down Dreykov who Natasha tried to assassinate some years earlier.After the events of Avengers: Endgame. There is something small scale about Black Widow. Nothing high stakes such as the fate of the entire universe being in peril. The movie suffers from not being a bombastic superhero movie.It really is an efficient spy/action movie with a couple of twists and turn. Harbour provides comedy as the Red Guardian. Weisz if effective as the mother figure but is underused.Winstone though seems to be coasting as the villain with a shifting Russian accent.
35,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) :
Brief Review -Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest."
36,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fuIts a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu."
37,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth itWOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimesAnother frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnnafter endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. WowAll in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to! (3 viewings, 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021)"

40,"Is the red hot case in this movie that i underestimated at all levels before viewing, if you search the wikipedia for relevant information on the true facts you will be impressed how the writers and directors have spun a trully develish endaring parapsychologic gory horror thriller story like taken outta the 1980's best ''thing''ishly made products.What i admire most of all is the use of enerving background music that makes your goosebumps scream '' dont turn your back to it'', and the mix of special effects and brilliantly made scene staging, the use of light and dark, sound effects and bloody gory physical fights that will linger your vegetative nerve system for all its worth and may shake your abundant teratomas back to life, like ripley said,''believe it or not.There are some black holes in the timeline of the story, and some intriscic factors that youll find hard to add up when watching, but i was simply overwhelmed by the scare factor that becomes so dominant all the way from the start.Acting is not the top notch on the hyperbel curvature, but still good enough to make you think ''ive got to see this one more time, at the cinema''. So if your in for shock and awe and a little bit of a mental freakshow, do as the grumpy old man did, view it . A big recommend and still searching for my teratoma."
41,"From the first time Malignant was announced, it was called James Wan's giallo film.A few thoughts on that.It's a giallo film as much as Suspiria is a giallo. That's because most people think, ""Italian horror with red and blue colors equals giallo,"" which is much like someone thinking that all hip hop is rap or all metal has blast beats, maybe. It's a generalization and you know, you have to be fine with it. In a world where reviewers from publications as big as Variety can't understand that Halloween is not a rehash of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you have to expect that some movies need a handle for people to better understand them.To the rest of us, those that haunted the aisles of the video stores minutes before closing, that carried lists of films in our wallets, that went from small town to town trying to find that magical movie drug that our store had no more supply of, I can tell you, if this movie had a Filmirage logo before it, the dubbing was off and a CGI Donald Pleasence or Donald O'Brien showed up, I would not be more surprised.This isn't a giallo. Sure, there's a giallo looking killer with a weapon somehow more ridiculous than the one in Too Beautiful to Die that has identity issues and a history of family madness much like Madhouse, but nope. This is the kind of movie that Screaming Mad George would have done the effects for, that would have had a trailer for Fatal Frames before it, that should have a piece of masking tape with green magic marker that says ""MUST BE 18 TO RENT"" emblazoned on it.So for every review I see that says, ""This has a bonkers third act!"" or ""It starts slow but hold on,"" I wonder, have I done too many movie drugs? Have I inhaled too deeply on the fumes of not only the Argento, Fulci, Henenlotter and Raimi - hail to those mentioning Darkman - that keep getting called out in these reviews, but also Full Moon, D'Amato, Lenzi, Stuart Gordon and so many more? Hell yeah I have. And I have no regrets. Movies mean more to me than most people. They've treated me better than most people. And I get the feeling that this is the kind of movie for people like me.Make no mistake - no movie has made me laugh out loud more this year than Malignant. And no movie made in 2021 will probably bring me so much joy because I kind of love that someone gave Wan $40 million to make a movie for people who say, why don't they make stuff like George Eastman's Metamorphosis or Tibor Takács' I, Madman any more.This is a movie that has a villain that feels like a character someone rolled up using the random character generator tables in an old school role playing game like Champions or Gamma World. ""What'd you roll up,"" we ask a young James Wan. ""Well, he has a giant sword that he made out of a doctor's award. And he can control lightning. And he dresses like he came right out of Strip Nude for Your Killer.""""Cool.""""I'm not done. He can also talk to people through radios.""I mean, can you not see the lunatic zeal of that? And sure, the acting is so bad that you wonder that it just might be a directorial choice - and if so, I love it - but this is also the kind of movie where the fact that Seattle is built above another city gets called out and kind of forgotten - unless you consider that this movie was built on the ashes of stuff like Ghosthouse, Castle Freak and Basket Case - and there's a moment where a character falls out of one part of the movie into another, effectively breaking the narrative just as surely as her body smashes through a house.Is Malignant a transmission from an alternate universe where Wan never stopped making pure junk - and I say that with affection - like Dead SIlence*? Is it someone trying to not have to make Hollywood sequels and screaming for help? Who can say. It's a mess, a glorious, ridiculous, unfocused mess packed with astounding levels of gore and several upbeat songs that don't fit the film at all.I'm shocked it didn't have someone discussing who is more popular in Denver, Kim Basinger or Kelly LeBrock over a ham radio.And in case it didn't come through, I loved this giant steaming pile of movie junk food.*I've done my best not to put any spoilers in here, but there's a security footage moment in here that has puppet work as bonkers and gory as when the villain behind that aforementioned film turned a family patriarch into a human puppet."
42,"James Wan's name was suffice to pull me into seeing this. This movie has a solid n creepy twist with lots of gory mayhem n it has a nice pace.But the the foggy lair looked phony.Also the hospital on top of a hill and the parking of a car almost at the end of a fence less cliff is way too ridiculous.The chase scene was not at all required as it was unbelievable. Also a cop coming face to face with a killer and still not believing the existence of such a killer is again wtf.The sister of the lead female character walks in n outta a hospital n gets access to all the files and that too like a piece of cake.Wasn't it the job of the cops to get access to the files?They have kept it open for a sequel as aft so much mayhem n so many dead police officers, a particular character's fate needs to be seen.(Hiding the character's name to avoid spoilers).Whether that character will be thrown in a jail, or a psychiatric ward or an army research center.I thot i saw a fatter Zoe Bell lookalike but was surprised when i saw her name on imdb.Zoe Bell is totally wasted.She has indeed put on lottuva weight."
43,"Well just okay! Malignant starts out with a curiosity! What's going on here at the hospital? Then we have a women in a abusive relationship. There is many Wan movie scares of bumps, and creeks in the night. Malignant gets interesting, but suddenly turns into Jeepers Creepers. Predictable and lame was the ending. Watchable, but over the top like 80's horror movie. I found the music and shots was an 80 tribute. Like many 80's horror movie Malignant is b ish. Watchable but forgettable."
44,"After her abusive husband is murdered, Maddie (Annabelle Wallis) must try and convince the cops that the killer was her imaginary childhood friend Gabriel. Just as the police are ready to label Maddie a basket case, chuck her in a madhouse and throw away the key, Gabriel makes his presence known...James Wan's Malignant begins like so many contemporary supernatural horrors, with a creepy, lank-haired figure lurking in the shadows (of which there are many), occasionally emerging from the darkness to scare protagonist Maddie. The movie is so predictable that, when it shows an award on a doctor's shelf, the trophy boasting a wicked spike, I rolled my eyes: 'Someone's getting impaled on that', I said to myself. And sure enough...It's formulaic stuff, but director Wan is toying with his audience, deliberately laying on the clichés, waiting patiently to pull the rug from under our feet with an outrageous plot twist that shifts the film from a mediocre chiller to an insanely enjoyable, off-the-wall gore-fest in a split second. This abrupt change in style and tone doesn't seem to have gone down too well with some viewers, but I really dug it - it caught me off-guard just as I was about to dismiss the film as just another dull spook-fest. Wan's absurd revelation prior to the final act propels the film into totally bonkers territory, and allows the director to ladle on the splatter as well as inject some well-handled action scenes.After so many dreary horror films that take themselves far too seriously, Malignant is a treat for those who enjoy movies that go a little mad sometimes."

49,"Greetings again from the darkness. THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) and UNBREAKABLE (2000) created a movie bond with filmmaker M Night Shyamalan that will always exist. In other words, I continue to go into each of his projects with hopeful expectations of another classic. Of course, some have been pretty good (SPLIT, 2016), while others are barely watchable (THE LAST AIRBENDER, 2010). His latest lands somewhere in the middle, but does feature a stunning beach setting (Dominican Republic) - one whose tropical beauty hides a sinister reality.The film's synopsis is captured in the trailer: tourists experience a mystifying and terrifying phenomenon while on a day trip to a gorgeous secluded beach. The director adapted the film from the 2010 graphic novel ""Sandcastle"", written by Pierre-Oscar Levy and Frederick Peeters. Shyamalan specializes in one thing: big and creative ideas. He is a risk-taking filmmaker, but one not always focused on execution, coherence, or details. Especially awkward here is the dialogue. None of these characters talk like real people. Lending to the awkwardness is the attention given to each character's name and occupation ... except for the kids, where age is the significant data.Due to the nature of the story (and the effects of the beach), the cast is significantly larger than the number of characters. We ride along with one family as they first approach the luxury resort. Insurance actuary Guy (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his wife, museum curator Prisca (Vicky Krieps) are vacationing with their 11 year old daughter Maddox (Alexa Swinton) and 6 year old son Trent (Nolan River). The couple clearly have a strained relationship and appear headed for a break-up. Encouraged by the resort manager to spend the day at a secret remote beach, they are joined by Charles (Rufus Sewell), a surgeon, his calcium-deficient trophy wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee), their young daughter Kara, and the doctor's elderly mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant). Another couple is there as well, nurse Jarin (Ken Leung) and his wife Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a psychologist. Already at the beach when they arrive is rap star Mid-sized Sedan (Aaron Pierre), replete with bloody nose and the corpse of the woman who accompanied him.It's best not to go into specifics about the progression of things for these folks on the beach, but it can be noted that they frantically try to find a way back to the resort. When all attempts prove unsuccessful, that ridiculous dialogue fills in many of the gaps for us, though you should know the science doesn't hold up ... think of it as fantasy instead. As their day at the beach moves forward, other actors take over: Alex Wolff and Thomasin McKenzie are teenage Trent and Maddox, Eliza Scanlen is Kara, and later, Emun Elliott and Embeth Davidtz become Trent and Maddox. It becomes frustrating for viewers as the professions are emphasized: Guy spouts statistics at every turn, Prisca discloses she's not a pathologist, and Patricia attempts to get everyone to bring their feelings to group. Ugh.Despite the many missteps and the overall mess of characterizations, Shyamalan (who also appears as the driver who drops them at the beach) does serve up a creative idea - one that will likely get viewers questioning their own mortality. Mental illness is addressed in a crude manner with Rufus Sewell (a fine actor) bearing the brunt of a poor script, while physical afflictions and the effects of age come off a bit better. The strange looking woman serving up custom cocktails at the resort is Francesca Eastwood (Clint's daughter), and Shyamalan's patented plot twist ending does make sense and even has a contemporary feel to it."
50,"Yeah, I get it. There are a lot of superhero movies. But saying there are too many is like saying there are too many slashers or comedies. It's a genre in and out of itself that can tell a variety of different stories. And nobody has done a better job of that than James Gunn, who started in the world of Troma and low budget horror like Slither before making Super and then taking over his own part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Guardians of the Galaxy.But let me tell you - this is basically a high budget low budget film with a heart and you'd be silly to skip it. What other movie would be audacious enough to - spoiler warning - kill more than half its cast including most of the names on the poster before the credits even begin?Where David Ayer's Suicide Squad was pretty much considered a fumble - I liked the Deadshot moments and seeing the cast on screen - this movie fully lives up to the premise of John Ostrander's run on the comic book. These are the very lowest of the low when it comes to super-villainy, forced by the American government to do missions where there's every single chance they'll die, whether at the hands of their enemy, one another or by the bombs implanted in their heads by their team leader Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, perhaps given less to do in this movie but nailing exactly who the character is).Two different versions of Task Force X have been sent to the island of Corto Maltese to destroy Jötunheim, a laboratory that holds the secret of Project Starfish. One team - led by Rick Flag made up of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, who has this character down as perfect as it gets), Captain Boomerang (a sadly wasted Jai Courtney), Savant (Michael Rooker), The Detachable Kid (Nathan Fillion), Javelin (Flula Borg), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Weasel (all CGI and looking like Bill the Cat) and Blackguard (Pete Davidson) will take the beach. The other - using them as a distraction - is Peacemaker (a perfect John Cena), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian, not the first choice for a superhero character or actor, which should explain a bit of this movie to you) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior).This is a deep cut, but even Squad pilot Briscoe shows up to fly their transport. Deeper still is getting characters like Calendar Man, Kaleidoscope and Double Down into the prison.There's really no way that I can be subjective in my review of this. The Ostrander-era Suicide Squad is my favorite comic of all time and I subscribe to its modern remix Copra - you should too RIGHT NOW - and this movie completely hits all of the right notes, from how Killer Shark could eat anyone on the team at any time to Savant running from the battle and paying the price.So yeah. There are a lot of superhero movies. There is only one that has a kaiju starfish, a man who loves peace so much that he'd kill for it, full-frontal male nudity and perhaps the most gore I've ever seen in a mainstream film, as well as moments in the Project Starfish lab that would not feel out of place in an Italian zombie film.Movies can be and should be escapist fun. In a world where nearly every DC film has faltered to almost astounding levels, unable to even get the character of Superman correct in the last few decades, Gunn hits it out of the park. I can't wait for the Peacemaker show and whatever comes next.This is how you should feel after watching a blockbuster, folks."
51,"We are introduced to Savant (Michael Rooker) in the first scene. Don't get too attached. A second squad is made up to infiltrate Jutunheim on Corto Maltese island and get information on Project Starfish which has alien technology.I loved this film. It was funny and fresh unlike the other DC comic films. The Starfish takes on human consciousnesses similar to ""The Attack of the Crab Monster"" and has a certain ""Stay Puft"" silliness. Many dark comedy elements like Idris Elba's relationship with his daughter. LOL funny. Worth watching twice.Guide: Plenty of F-words. Implied sex. Brief nudity."
52,"I can't believe it's five years since I watched Suicide Squad at the cinema, I still moan about the waste of time and money, I loathed it.I went into this one with a degree of scepticism, but within the first five minutes, something just feels different, and that vibe continues through to the end, it is a totally different production, one I thoroughly enjoyed, it doesn't matter what kind of film you like, there is something here for you, it's funny, it's dark, it's of course action packed, and if like me, you like a bit of gore, then you may just find yourself enjoying this.I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a hyped up film, I always seem to be at odds with the critics, however this time they're right.The acting does vary a little I would say, Idris Elba is just brilliant, it's nice to see him doing something a little different, I just wish Capaldi had a slightly bigger role.So good, I'm already booked in for a second viewing, 8/10."
53,"A team of super-villains can shorten their jail sentences by going on missions as the titular Suicide Squad. They're not expected to return, and they definitely won't if they stray from the mission, or disobey direct orders, and have their implanted explosives detonated.It's the kind of ridiculous, contrived concept that we don't expect to work outside of a comic book. Not even in an adaptation. And yet, it does, incredibly well. You'll be surprised by how much you care about some of the members. Others are deliciously despicable, and we hate their guts. The level of interpersonal conflict is fun, and yet you can believe that someone would intentionally put all these people together. The action is tremendously enjoyable. No two characters are overly similar, no one disappears into the background, everyone does at least one major memorable thing, and like in Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn(Robbie, continuing to prove she's the perfect choice, she completely understands what makes Harleen tick) is given great scenes, dialogue, depth.James Gunn brings all of his strengths to this. He handles the ensemble cast without getting bogged down in their introductions: instead, he uses an impactful, if short one for each, giving them something quick yet defining to do early after we meet them, and, of course, utilising, without abusing, the useful narrative shortcut of exposition. This is emotional, if not as much as the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The use of music fits and is effective, not on the nose boring choices that play only very briefly, and are followed up maybe a minute later with another cue. While I have to admit that this is the first R-rated picture of his that I watched, I would definitely say that he should get to do more of these in the future. It still doesn't feel like he's awkwardly constrained when he works with a PG-13, but he really knows how to use the freedom here. We do get ridiculous amounts of violence(and swearing. It is thankfully nearly completely devoid of gratuitous sexuality and nudity, that would only distract. Of course I wouldn't be against it if it served a purpose; there is no time in this when that would have been the case, though) that is expected from this kind of thing, yes, meanwhile, We also get some legitimately powerful, disturbing material. Of course not every film has to ""have something to say""; however, it can be extremely gratifying when we see one that does(and does it well), and this is one of those instances.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. They give you an excellent idea of what to expect. 8/10."
54,"Finding the 2016 one (-also reviewed) to be a jumbled mess, I was hesitant to take a look at the new version, until I began to notice a large number of reviews stating surprise at how good the movie was,which led to me and a pal going to meet the new squad.View on the film:Wiping the slate clean with a blazing pre-credits opening, writer/directing auteur James Gunn reunites with cinematographer Henry Braham, and lays out an expansion of his recurring themes and motifs across the galaxy in a distinctive elaborate colour palette that shines in close-ups on the unconventional group of anti-heroes.Keeping to practical effects as much as possible,the screenplay by Gunn uses the Men on a Mission set-up to unleash a live-wire genre mash-up,that goes right back to his Comedy Horror roots, via zombies,sharks and tentacle Monster Movie, that are combined with Gunn's tongue in cheek zinger dialogue looped round each Squad member, whose bond starts to crack with betrayal as they take on the main part of the mission.Backed by a criss-cross of John Murphy's jaunty score and James Gunn's spot-on song choices, the ensemble cast give outstanding performances, with Margot Robbie and John Cena giving wicked pitch black comedic turns as Quinn and Peacemaker as Gunn fires stylish long tracking shots following the gloriously gory, thrilling Action set-piece carnage they leave behind.Perfectly balancing the comedic line from Robbie and Cena, Idris Elba brings a gravitas to the level-headed Bloodsport,whilst Daniela Melchior captures the deeply flawed, but well meaning optimistic heart of the group as Ratcatcher 2,a piper who leads the Squad to victory."
55,"Okay so cruella was actually kind of amazing. The cinematography and costuming were breathtakingly beautiful. The storyline took a few weird turns, but for the most part really worked. The characters were well cast and well acted. The Emma's slayed being maniacally deranged."
56,"Ah the name puns. You gotta have them, right? The answer is obviously yes. So a bad or rather evil character as we know her ... or knew her? - is now back with an origin story. I have to admit, I have some issues with the movie overall or rather the morality is serves. Not to mention the kind of making away of what she becomes ... or making it ok, because of what happened to her.If you are able to leave those thoughts to the side and not be clouded by them, you may be able to enjoy this more. The story is quite straightforward - you have the evil Emma and the good Emma - which will become Evil. Sorry I can't just put this to the side. Obvious name choices to the side (and convenient happenings/accidents too), the actors do a fantastic job. The movie is quite dark for a family entertainment entry, but so was the 101 Dalmatians ... to a point.If you love those involved, you will get more out of it too. If you love dresses, you will have the time of your life - no pun intended."
57,"And pretty malificent. Its the best live action disney movie made for ages. I cant find anything that drags this movie down from the throne of heavenly made movies for the silver screen. Having raised three children with all the animated dalmatian film on autorepeat x 1000, i thought i knew the story about the real cruella, but now shes my new favourite.Extremely good roleplay by emma and emma, horace and jasper where a delight, and the whole ensemble delivers for over 140 minutes. The production design, the filmographic artwork and supersharp editing left both me and my wife drop our jaws so no we smack gobs at eachother, dribbling snot and tears over the pityful story about cruella deville.Do i recommend this film... YES...and do watch it in the cinema its just too extravagant for your flatscreen and 10 watts sound surround system.imax here comes the grumpy old man.P.s. I forgot to mention the soundtracks chosen int making this a smooth ride of silverscreen passion, and the original score mustve been inspired by the sound of a DeVil. Im stunned and far over the limit on heartrate right now,'' så løp og kjøp'' as we say in norwegian commercials..."
58,I give all Disney remakes a fair opportunity to entertain me without judging before hand.After sitting through a time waster. This movie was a huge mutty stinker. A major time waster. Full of nothing.Last words: another reason to cancel my Disney Minus account.
59,"I repeatedly go back to these disney live action movies because i love maleficent so much. But they keep failing me. To be fair, a movie centered around female fashion is likely to have a low success rate in my book. But this movie didn't really do much for me. And there were a bunch of stupid parts. I had trouble getting through it.The best parts of this movie were emma stone and paul walter hauser. He is always likeable and continues to impress me (1 viewing, 6/1/2021)"
60,"Infinite is apparently based upon a series novels and now adapted into a big budget film. With a relatively interesting premise and concept, the end result isn't great. This film lacks suspense, mystery and good writing. Mark Wahlberg doesn't seem to fit the character.This feels like a film which takes parts from other past greater films. And what we have is something quite confusing and not that engaging or entertaining. Quite disappointing.The signs that this film wasn't going to be anything special was it being rescheduled from a theatrical release to a straight to streaming release (and only a few months notice in advance). It was set up for a sequel and to kick start a franchise, though due to the struggles and criticism of this film, we highly doubt a sequel will be made."
61,"I had low expectations for this movie, but it didn't even meet them. I suppose there were worse action movies out there, but just not worth the time."
62,"I stumbled upon the 2021 movie ""Infinite"" and actually hadn't even heard about it prior to getting to sit down to watch it. Weird, I know, right?But I must admit that the movie's synopsis sounded interesting enough, and usually Mark Wahlberg tends to provide adequate entertainment, so of course I gave ""Infinite"" a watch.And I will say that writers Ian Shorr and Todd Stein definitely managed to churn out a story that provided with solid entertainment for the course of the movie. And it was a storyline that actually had a lot of interesting aspects to it. So yeah, I was definitely well entertained while watching ""Infinite"".This movie is driven by a good combination of action and storytelling. Sure, this wasn't a tongue in cheek narrative that required all that much attention from the viewers, but the writers managed to make the storyline deep enough to actually involve the audience a bit more than just popcorn munching.And yeah, the storyline does come off as being rather predictable, which it also is at times.There were some moments in the movie where the laws of physics were simply and blatantly just disregarded, which made me curl my toes. But it was just a minor thing, because the movie proved to be entertaining.Sure, this is essentially your average run-of-the-mill action movie with Mark Wahlberg, and a lot of things could be said for his acting. But I was entertained for the action ride that it was.I am rating ""Infinite"" a six out of ten stars. The movie is worth a watch, as it combines action and story well enough."
63,"It's literally a Mark Wahlberg movie. It should be such a genre, Drama, Comedy, Adventure, Mark Wahlberg, History, Action... You get what you expect from a Wahlberg movie."
64,"Infinite takes style over substance to a new level.I heard about this movie a week ago when a coworker told me the trailer was hot. I'll say this about the Antoine Fuqua flick, he took a four-to-five-minute trailer and extended into a full movie. That's actually impressive that he was able to keep up the energy for the entire movie.Of course, that does make for one problem. The action is hot, the visuals are stunning and the style is wild, but then there is that slow moment in the film when Markie Mark's character is explained. He's a special human being that gets reincarnated over and over again but is fully aware of his past lives. He's not the only one and a collective of these people have taken two sides: one good, one evil.It's around here that I realize this movie is missing something. That sounds strange to say considering John Wick is one of the best action movies I've ever seen with a plot so cliché, it literally pokes fun of itself. It worked for Wick but it does not click here.The unclicking plot reminds me of the Old Guard (Both stories about a form of immortality). I hate to say that I like this movie more. Like I said, it's got the style, it's also got the action and the combination makes for a flick that looks like I would have blindly paid 25 bucks to see this on an IMAX screen (I never got that feeling from the Old Guard).It's too bad Charlize Theron did not get cast in this one instead. Markie Mark felt utterly useless in this flick. I don't think I've seen Wahlberg be so dull. Old age must be catching up with him. He did not even make me laugh. Realistically, you could have replaced him with a wooden board and it would not affect this movie.Chiwetel Ejiofor was the only notable performance in the film. Somehow his bad guy got through all the fluff and was able to shine.I was hoping to get the same shine out of Jason Mantzoukas who's usually good for one laugh as the comedy relief, but all his jokes were swing and miss.Well, I don't want to say too many bad things about the movie, but I feel this goes into the vault of Ninja Assassin for me. It's an action movie I'll tell people was good, but whenever I see it every few years, I watch it like I never saw it cause I always forget why I like it. A little unfair comparison for Ninja Assassin, but I see Infinite going down this road.I enjoyed it while I enjoyed but its forgettable."
65,"Bear with me for a second. I am going to compare this to another movie. And the comparison will be ... not the strongest for most I reckon. The movie I am talking about is Unforgiven. Now obviously the main character couldn't be more different. Young vs old, experienced vs no experience at all.Why I do like and see a connection you ask? Because both are a takedown, a dismantling of what we know, of what movies and other sources may have told us. Whereas it was about the cowboy myth in Unforgiven, which I have to rewatch asap, or the impression(s) we have of Knights in this.Having said that, it doesn't mean the director here was thinking of the Clint Eastwood classic, but just had it as a general idea too. I also should note that I have not seen the ""other versions of"" this movie, as they are referred to here on imdb. So there are a few other movies that are based on the same story I reckon.Now onto this, that has so many things working for it. Set design, costume design, cinematography and most of all: sound and music design. And this is not about it being loud (which it is at times), it is about how careful it is designed to draw you in ... to give you every little thump, every little crack, every small but also big sound that the enviroment is able to provide. Exceptional would not even begin to cover it. I usually am not so aware of that department, but if this does not at least get nominated for an Oscar ... well something is wrong I'd say.The acting is amazing as well. But be wary, because the pacing will not be to everyone's liking. I went into this without any knowledge - except having seen the poster (knew Dev Patel was starring) and therefor knowing the title. Which is always helpful when ordering a ticket at your local cinema.Apart from the pacing, the movie may have beautiful cinematography as mentioned, but it is not afraid of the dark (no pun intended). It really relishes in it at times. So much so, that you may even curse because you can't make out much. It almost feels like this was shot with natural light only. I imagine they used film lights too, but especially those dark passages will have you believe otherwise. I have not checked, might do when the movie comes out on disc.So all in all this is far removed from any popcorn version of heroes and knights ... but if you can dig that and how the movie handles many things - you are in for a ride (again no pun intended). If you liked it, stick with the movie and the credits for an additional scene - which will not mean anything to you if you didn't like the movie in the first place."
66,"As most artisanal movies go, the visually were breathtaking, with this aura hanging over ever scene. However, the storyline plot and dialogue were downright nonsensical, what the hell were even half those scenes about? I have no idea. Made no sense, I got lost and bored ten minutes in."
67,"This film; inspired the fourteenth century poem 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'. Shortly after the story begins a mysterious knight clad in green armour enters the king's court on Christmas day and challenges any knight to strike him... on condition that one year later that knight will find the knight in his green chapel and suffer an identical blow. Sir Gawain accepts the challenge and decapitates the knight; to his surprise the knight picks up his head and leaves. A year later Gawain heads out seeking the knight; the journey will be long and arduous; along the way he will meet various people; some friendly, others less so.I rather enjoyed this film; the story is suitably mystical with a strange feel to much of it. The film impressively captures the quest as Gawain travels though bleak landscapes encountering various characters. The Irish locations used are stunning in their rugged beauty. The cast does a solid job; most obviously Dev Patel in the role of Sir Gawain. Alicia Vikander is also notable in the dual roles of Essel, a woman Gawain loves, and the lady he meets in a castle shortly before his arrival at the Green Chapel. There are some ambiguous moments, including the ending that may irritate some viewers but I enjoyed them... not every film has to have everything explained. Overall an impressive film that is well worth watching. I watched it on television but imagine it looked even better on the big screen."
68,"""The Green Knight"" is a new movie in fact that just hit cinemas here and it is a co-production between Ireland, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and with this quartet nobody can really be surprised that it from beginning to end in the English language, even if thick accents are very frequent here. But let's take a look at the basics first: The writer and director is American filmmaker David Lowery, who has really received many accolades and awards now over the years and he launched his career as an editor, so it should not really surprise anybody that he also worked as an editor on this film here and on many other not too long ago, even if he has progressed to being the man in charge of the entire project as well. The title character is played by Dev Patel, who had his breakthrough with Slumdog Millionaire over a decade ago now, a film that won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Since then, he has also managed to score Oscar nominations himself and it is also kinda funny to compare his bearded self in 2021 with the boy he was back then briefly before the 2010s. He is in almost every scene from this movie from beginning to end and the only lead. Here and there, he is joined by the stunning Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander. Joel Edgerton is also always easy to identify and I kinda like the screen presence he has and the energy he usually brings to his roles. When he comments on the main character's language, there is also a really rare moment of comedy here almost. Not a funny movie. Does not aspire to be such. Back to the cast, there are other familiar faces like Barry Keoghan who you could recognize if you saw his Yorgos Lanthimos movie. He is easy to identify really, seemed to be a bit of a clumsy friend in his first scene, there to maybe to get in some comic relief, but turned out he is something else entirely.Keoghan is by the way an actor who originates from Ireland and this is why he also fit very nicely in this film. This is a really Irish movie, not only because of the strong presence of the color green, but also because of the names of locations and characters. Even Dev Patel, who is really everything but Irish, plays a character named Gawain. Enough said. By the way, he is not the title character, is he? I'm not sure. There is constantly talk about him (not) being a knight, but I kept thinking it's maybe the one who shows up initially to submit this challenge. That character, who we also see in the end again luckily, was almost more memorable to me than Patel's. He looked so amazing visually and everything fit there and I would immediately watch a film about this character. Great voice as well. Or how they show us the method through which the queen reads this very special letter at the beginning. And how it exhausts her right away when she is finished as if some evil spirit possessed her. You can discuss if this tree-like creature is evil. At least he has red blood as we see when he is decapitated. Or seemed to have been decapitated initially. And of course he did not feel any fear. He knew he could stay alive, maybe thanks to his magical axe. That axe was also a really nice inclusion. I mean look at tiny little plants coming out of the area around it when it is laid down. That was a really small moment, but great attention to detail and memorable as a consequence. Also, you must understand that this is not a superhero movie, evven if it is a fantasy movie. It may come easy to think of The Green Hornet, Green Lantern, Green Arrow... when reading the title, but it turns out something completely different. But still good.There are not too many flaws for me with this film, even if it also did not reach greatness for me overall. Or too rarely. I struggled a bit for example with how quickly the main character has a bit of a falling-out with Edgerton's character or also with the fox immediately afterwards who seemed like a loyal companion before that. That came a bit surprising for sure, but maybe also indicates how nothing is safe in terms of belonging and friendship when the adventure continues. Probably our hero here was a bit of a loner. Maybe also that is why he did not really have too much to lose when accepting the strange visitor's proposal and he was the only one who did. I just mentioned the fox. That one I have to go with again. I liked the scene in which he was introduced in a way with this woman who was actually a spirit. Also I really liked the way the fox was animated. Incredibly cute. I want that one in my life. But this animal also symbolized in a way that the protagonist did not want to be 100% alone as we see when he allows the fox (never know if I should say ""he"", ""she"" or ""it"", but one thing is safe: I won't say ""they"") to enter. Other highlights from this film except the little fox was the scene in which the ruthless fighter introduced himself and came to visit the king and bring him this letter. You could see that he was not scared at all because he knew he would get out there alive 100%. His laughter actually sounded on the evil side. The king asking the male protagonist before that to come sit with him did feel a bit random though, even if he was his nephew. The connection with the young man's mother and how she is potentially a witch. Well, that I was not too big on or added very little from me.Then there is the color green. Many beautiful shots including this. One I remember in particular is towards the end when out hero(?) is there and sees the creature he has been looking for. We see this shot in two different shades of green basically. Also Vikander's speech on the significance of the color green in nature, but also how men see it and react to it, was a true highlight. Vikander turned that monologue into something truly memorable and haunting. Big thumbs-up to her and that powerful scene alone proved that she is among the finest actresses from her generation as of now without a doubt. As I am getting closer to the end of this review, let me say a few words about the ending. It seemed like a lightning-speed fast-forward look at the coming decades when the protagonist returns and becomes kking, but his cowardice always haunts him and eventually also has him lose his head. So he will be headless no matter what. Then we see it was really just a what-if, a premonition you could say. There Lowery also toys a bit with the audience. When the forest creature compliments the boy that he finally understood and made the right choice, you could think that the crucial blow would be nothing devastating or murderous, but it probably is. We do not know 100% because this is where the film ends. With how he goes for him before that, I cannot imagine though that he let him live. By the way, I also liked there how the forest creature basically sits on his throne this calmly when Patel's character shows up. He has all the time in the world really and now all his focus is on resting, maybe sleeping. And the ""aye"" as an answer to this crucial question instead of a ""yes"" I appreciated too.So yeah, all in all a pretty good movie. I see critics liked these over two hours much more than general audiences apparently. I am not sure if I am surprised or not. I think this film has the potential for an even higher rating on rewatch and it feels like a very rewatchable movie that offers a great deal of quality even if you know the ending. Maybe especially if you know the ending. Perhaps then also some scenes will become bit clearer like what happened with the thieves in the forest (or their leader I should say) after they stole the axe. Or what was the meaning of the skeleton. We will see. But there is not the flightest doubt for my positive recommendation this time. It gets a thumbs-up for sure and I suggest you check this one out and as I am not always big on fantasy films, this mans something. Well done to Lowery and everybody else involved with the production and shooting of this one here. It also felt shorter to me which is always a good sign, especially when a movie crosses not only the 100-minute mark, but even the 120-minute mark. And pretty comfortably in fact. It's closer to two hours and fifteen minutes. A success from every perspective, no matter which one you look at: sound effects, direction, story, acting, visual effects, make-up, costumes, cinematography. I think it could score several Oscar nominations next year. And deservedly so. If I am not mistaken, it wasn't eligible yet for the 2021 Academy Awards."
69,"4/10 - the occasional pretty shot cannot save this uneventful, anticlimactic, and loose adaptation of a great Arthurian legend that isn't the masterclass in cinema that fellow viewers and critics claim it is."
70,"The imdb description reads ""A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path."" This is completely accurate, and yet is a superficial description. Yes, this is a movie about a woman attempting to create justice where none exists, but it's also about a deeply traumatized woman desperately doing things to give her a sense of control. This is why it's not a good criticism to say that what Cassie's doing doesn't make sense. It's true (like the IMDB description is true) but it's also the point. Cassie isn't Batman, and this isn't a cleverly thought-out system to make a better world. Cassie is broken but very smart and resourceful, and she is treating her inner wounds in an external way.The cast is very good, particularly Carey Mulligan as Cassie. The movie does a good job of keeping information from you and then dripping it out in order to create mystery and suspense then slow understanding. It's filmed stylishly. It's deeply disturbing, with a *very* dark view of human beings, and it leaves you with a lot to think about.It took me a while to watch this because I suspected it would be hard going and it is, in its own dark way, quite entertaining. Definitely worth watching."
71,"Carey Mulligan is Cassie. She had been a promising young medical student some 7 years earlier when something happened to her best friend, also a promising young medical student. Now approaching 30 Cassie works as a coffee barista and seems adrift. Until the old male nemesis from medical school comes back to town to get married.The writer-director says she wanted it to play as a very dark comedy, dealing with a very serious issue but with some humor in the scenes. Mulligan is great in the role and was nominated for Best Female Actor.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library, a very interesting and entertaining movie."
72,"I reckon it is or will be easy to dismiss what happens here for some. Unfortunately that does not make the things that are depict in here untrue. From a male perspective you may see different valid points throughout this ... you may feel that certain things do not apply to you. And maybe they don't - that doesn't mean that they don't exist. I know it feels like I'm repeating myself ... something the movie does avoid.Which is quite the feat, considering what it is about and how she goes on a hunt (prowl?) at nights ... I was not sure what she was doing and the movie did leave it upon a bit ... but it does clear up during the runtime. Now she is broken and we slowly get why that is. It is revealed in the right way, even while we do sort of know or feel that we know most of it.What is a nice touch, we never see anything in that regard. There is no sleaze, there is no (visible) exploitation going on. That does not mean it is easy to watch ... or listen to what is happening. I personally am not a fan of the term feminist, but this movie may change your mind regarding that or other things.There are borderline things happening and our main character is not perfect. That does not mean she does not deserve something good ... and it does look like she can have. If she can bring herself to let go ... on the other hand, there is more than meets the eye. Way more ... and the ending ... I'm not going to spoil it for you, but let's say I did not expect that at all.Very well told and truths that do hurt ... but are essential to be seen ... and learned from (hopefully)"
73,"What a gripping story! The ending is triumphant, and the journey to get there is very intense."
74,"A mostly different film in many ways, but my reaction to Promising Young Woman reminds me of the first time I saw Gone Girl and how I thought at first that I hated the ending but in fact, it's the perfect closer to an incredible ride of revenge from the lead character. Exquisitely directed by Emerald Fennell and led by the performance of a career in Carey Mulligan, PYW is a force to be reckoned with in 2020/2021. The wait was well worth it.9.5/10."
75,"I'm a fan of the original and I was intrigued to see this reboot, remake, re-imagining.I thought it was very clever to build on and incorporate the history of the first film whilst making a new story.A good fun film that builds on the canon of Candyman :)"
76,"I'm rly not sure why this film is so underrated. For me, it's way better than Don't breathe2 or Malignant."
77,"The direct sequel to Bernard Rose's 1992 cult classic of the same name attempts to carve its own identity in addition to serving as a follow-up chapter yet only manages to end up halfway on both fronts. As a sequel, it doesn't improve upon the original in any way, shape or form. And as its own thing, it's got many thoughts ongoing at once and needed to simmer down & spread them evenly to deliver the goods.Co-written & directed by Nia DaCosta, her intent, approach, tone & treatment is different from the first film, plus she also reworks the mythology to suit her own story. And though it isn't a complaint, the script is where the issue lies coz it doesn't have its priorities sorted out. It is crammed with too many ideas & themes and tries to cover them all in the limited runtime, thus resulting in an overstuffed & undercooked narrative.On the plus side, DaCosta's visual flair makes an instant impression, the camera manoeuvres through the polished set pieces with fluidity, and it sure doesn't hold back on its violent urges whenever the eponymous spirit is summoned. The actors do well with what they are given but would've done better if they had more material to work with. The film looks & sounds real fine but it is missing the immersive, alluring quality that its predecessor had in spades.Overall, Candyman does have a few interesting moments working in its favour but the film as a whole doesn't truly live up to its hype and is certainly no match to the original classic. It's a messy, convoluted take that lacks clarity & direction, comes off as preachy on few occasions, features subplots that go nowhere, and even ends abruptly. 90 mins isn't enough to cover all DaCosta wanted to cover here and so an extended runtime would've only benefitted her film."
78,"I'm rly not sure why this film is so underrated. For me, it's way better than Don't breathe2 or Malignant."
79,"Amateur night.The bad: this movie looks cheaply made and is cheap. Way below average acting performances, silly story, even sillier special effects, mediocre photography.Simply no thrill whatsoever.Not any good? I honestly cant think of any. It's not laughably bad, but it comes close...."
80,"When I sat down to watch the 2021 action crime movie titled ""Kate"" from writer Umair Aleem and director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, I must admit that I had been told that the movie wasn't all that great. But still, I opted to sit down to watch it and rate the movie based on my own impressions of what I saw.And let me say that I am glad that I did, because ""Kate"" turned out to be a rather entertaining movie for me. There was just something dynamic about the storyline that worked out quite well, and I will say that there wasn't a dull moment throughout the course of the movie.The story told in ""Kate"", as written by Umair Aleem, was well-written and nicely paced. It was a storyline that was easy to follow and actually takes you on an adrenaline-filled thrill ride. So the writer managed to put together a very wholesome and entertaining storyline here.I was immediately submerged and drawn into the setting and the plot of ""Kate"", so the movie turned out to be rather enjoyable for me.Visually then ""Kate"" is a great movie, especially with the setting of the whole thing.

And the actors and actresses definitely performed well in the movie and brought their characters to life on the screen in a fulfilling manner.I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Kate"", and it feels like a good old fashioned action crime movie, one that you can watch more than just once.My rating of ""Kate"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."
81,"We have all these negative wanna be critics who wouldn't know a great movie if it was programmed into their small brain. I bet all the 1s and 2s are anti vaccine and dont wear masks. The theme of this film is so accurate, America is no longer a great country it's become a selfish all about me country. Other countries like chinaand japan deserve to be the new super powers we have shown we dont care and no longer deserve it. While we fight and become more divided they're becoming bigger, better and working for the greater good of their country. Greatest country ever, yeah right, in 1950."
82,"Why do I do it, why do I always think that the number one choice is going to be good, it never is, and there's a good example of it here.Kate has 24 hours to get revenge on those that poisoned her, that's literally the plot, that start is followed by the most improbable, crazy fight sequences you will ever see.It goes on a bit, it looks pretty good, I loved the visuals, but that's the best element, the story is wafer thin, it lacks any sort of heart.Good acting, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is cracking, I am a big fan, sadly Woody isn't around for much, and that's a real shame.All in all, another disappointing film on Netflix, 5/10."

84,"Poisoned by a radioactive element, assassin Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a day to find the person responsible for her agonising predicament and make them pay for their actions.Just recently, we've been treated to two female fronted action thrillers, each starring one of my favourite (ie., tastiest) actresses as a highly-trained killer: Gunpowder Milkshake with Karen Gillan, and Kate, featuring Mary Elizabeth Winstead, which borrows its basic structure from noir classic D. O. A. (1949), and injects it with hyper-violent action. Winstead is far more convincing than Gillan as a hard-as-nails contract killer, her action scenes executed with more aplomb, but the film as a whole is only marginally more successful, with director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan placing too much emphasis on style: EVERYTHING is drenched in neon, and characters are prone to introspective rambling, thereby allowing the pace to grind to a halt between fight scenes. There's also an incredibly bad CGI car chase, and an annoying teenage sidekick (Miku Patricia Martineau), while the usually scrummy Winstead looks absolutely awful for most of the film, her character visibly suffering the effects of the Polonium-204 with which she has been poisoned (to make herself look worse, Kate also hacks off her hair for no reason).Of course, despite the sickness that is eating away at her body, Kate is still able to defeat numerous male opponents in a fist-fight and also bests everyone when it comes to a gunfight. The action is hard-hitting, occasionally insanely gory, and totally improbable, but that's precisely the reason why most will choose to watch the film and they will get what they came for: fast, furious John Wick inspired mayhem that pushes plausibility to the limits. It's just a shame that there wasn't a bit more of the ballistic craziness and a little less of the dull soul searching from our heroine.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."
85,"The guy who won't shut up about family has a long lost brother he's never mentioned ?Put your brain into fridge and enjoy ;)
I know they did terrible movie, terrible mistakes, insulting to Physics and etc, but it was kind of fun although :)))5 / 10."
86,The gang receives a transmission with Mr. Nobody. He had captured Cipher but the plane has crashed. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is reluctant to go on another mission and risk his family but Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) convinces him. There is a MacGuffin and Dom's newly revealed brother Jakob (John Cena). Family...The full title is Leprechaun 4: In Space. It's a bit of an insult to tag your movie In Space. Leprechaun is a campy horror-comedy franchise and its self-mocking humor uses the insult to its advantage. F&F has been approaching that line over the years and it may be a moment of jumping the shark. F&F started originally as a semi-serious fun cars & babes franchise. The action has gotten more and more ridiculous to the point of superhero unreality. Tyrese Gibson is doing a meta commentary while questioning his invulnerability. It's fitting that he and Ludacris are the ones going into space. Tyrese is the silly comic relief but it's getting out of hand. This series is being so ridiculous that it is almost critic-proof in that respect. No nay-sayer is going to win an argument by pointing out the outlandish non-sensical action scenes. We already know and it's why we watch the movies. It is what it is at this point.
87,"Greetings from Lithuania.While with 9 th film in the series they threw all physics and realism out of the window, i would lie if i would say if it wasn't entertaining flick for a boring evening. It was well paced by a veteran of a series Justin Lin - at running time 2 h 20 min i barely was bored. I liked the craftsmanship of this movie - you can clearly see that a lot of money were spent into making this one. The last action sequence alone was made in a daylight - those cost way more so i have to give a credit for it. Sure, the story is your typical stuff about saving the world, i just kinda went with it and had fun.Overall, definitely not a worst in a series (4th i think is still the weakest one), but far from the best (i love 3rd and 5th parts), F9 is big, very dumb but skilfully made movie that is entertaining. Sometimes that is all you want to see."
88,"After 8 instalments and a spinoff, we should know the drill. At the top of the list is: family. F9 is heavy with the back story. The backbone is the familiar Boromir/Faramir complex, except that this Faramir is a bad guy, at least to start with. John Cena plays Dom's younger brother Jakob. Flashbacks with Vinnie Bennett and Finn Cole playing the brothers have enough screen time to have these two young stars lay claim on having a mini movie themselves.Another thing is that there are enough resurrections in the F&F series to give it legitimate claim to be an Easter movie. The most shattering was of course Letty. This time, it is Han. There is really no point in dwelling on the plot twists. He looks older and gloomy, understandably, after losing Gisele. Unfortunately, she is unlikely to be brought back to life. Don't think the budget can afford Gal Gadot anymore. The saddest thing is of course, in real life, the loss of Paul Walker. Can't believe it has already been nearly a decade.Yet another thing is the stars. The two Oscar best actresses are still here, more than just a cameo and less than a role of any substance. Charlize's scenes are spread out while Helen Mirren's are clustered in the middle. Hobbs and Shaw (Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham), however, have found greener pasture in their own spin off, for which I can hardly wait for the sequel, for Vanessa Kirby if not for the two of them. Kurt Russell, as ""Mr. Nobody"", is still around, if you are his fan.At the end of the day, it's those who still survive (Letty, Mia, Roman, Tej) plus, here to stay, Ramsey, played by lovely Nathalie Emmanuel, proving that there is life after Missandei. The plots may get half-baked, the action may get tedious, the gimmicks may get ludicrous (driving a CAR in space!), but I'll continue watching the F&F franchise, for the family."
89,"As Tej (played by Ludacris) says in the movie: ""as long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine, okay?""Yeah, that concept is right out the window in this movie. Literally. But hey, at least this 2021 movie titled ""F9"" made for some really good laughs.Granted, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from director Justin Lin's movie here, as the franchise has been one steady downhill ride since after the first movie. And with each movie things become more and more outrageous and out of hand. In fact, by now the movie franchise ought to be renamed into ""The Outrageous and Ludicrous"".Still, I had the opportunity to watch ""F9"", and so I did, as I hadn't already seen it. And yeah, ""F9"" was as laughable as I had anticipated it.Actually, Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) actually summarized how I was feeling throughout the entire movie here, with one single line that she uttered in the movie; ""you got to be kidding me.""Visually then ""F9"" was good. Yeah, I will say that much, because the visuals definitely are top notch and help carry the movie, as basically everything else in the movie wasn't doing much for the movie.And yeah, they had a very impressive cast ensemble for ""F9"", I will admit that much. What does amaze me, however, is that people on the cast list don't stop up and go ""really?"" when they read the script. But I guess, a dollar is a dollar, huh?If you sit down to watch ""F9"", you have to put aside anything called laws of physics and realism. Because all those concepts are non-existing in this movie. And the abundance of things that was downright laughable and outrageous in ""F9"" is countless, but at least they provided me with a heap of laughs. Yeah, I couldn't help laugh throughout the majority of this movie, because it was just so bad.""F9"" is a watchable movie, but it is essentially just another testimony to why the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise should have stopped after ""Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift"".I am rating ""F9"" a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. This is a movie that left no impressions on me, and it is one that will just quietly fade into oblivion, given its ludicrous over-the-top lack of respect for laws of physics, gravity and realism."
90,"This hardly qualifies as a film. It's basically porn with some random cringey lines and scenes stringed together. The actors can hardly even be called that and the direction is below amateur. The film essentially romanticizes kidnapping and rape too, and for that it should be ashamed. This is truly the bottom of the barrel for 2020."
91,"Success on Netflix, film '365 DNI' is not a novel: it's abuse made upAmong the most popular on the platform, Polish film bets on unhealthy and abusive relationship to win fans of erotic productions
With the sun high in the Sicilian blue sky, a heartthrob with a millimeter-sculpted body jumps into the crystalline waters of the Mediterranean Sea to save his beloved, who fell from the bow of a luxurious boat. Back in the safety of the vessel, the lovebirds celebrate the rescue by splurging on sex - intense and nothing prudish, the sequence unfolds in every room. The scene is 365 DNI, a Polish film, adapted from the book of the same name by Blanka Lipinska, which emerged in the first place in the ranking of most popular Netflix in Brazil this week. Conservatism aside, the feature would, in theory, integrate the field of erotic novels, were it not for the fact that it is not a romance at all - or at least it should not be considered as such given the fact that Laura, the beautiful Polish woman saved from drowning by Massimo was actually kidnapped by him.Whoever escapes the film, clarifies that kidnapping here is not an exaggeration or figure of speech. Massimo Torricelli, played by the undeniably beautiful Michele Morrone, is the leader of an influential family in the Italian mafia that, since losing his murdered father, dreams of the image of Laura Biel, lived with merits by the Polish Anna Maria Sieklucka, who leaves nothing to be desired by the ""romantic"" couple in terms of beauty. Driven by an unhealthy obsession, the mobster travels around the world looking for him, and when he finally finds it, he decides that the best way to win his love is by using narcotics to dope her and lock her up at home. Upon waking up in a bed as luxurious as it is unknown, Laura tries to escape, but is stopped by the kidnapper, who imposes a proposal on her (if you can call it that, since he doesn't give her any other option): she has 365 days to fall in love with him, if at the end of this time nothing changes, you can leave.Were it not for the protagonist's admirable physical attributes, the mansion that serves as captivity or the millions in clothing for the prisoner - who, against his will, becomes a luxury escort at mafia parties, it is hard to imagine that anyone would see romance in history. But with the glamor included in the package, part of the audience seems to regard it as a modern fairy tale - a kind of contemporary Beauty and the Beast, which romanticizes kidnapping and an apparent Stockholm syndrome. On social media, there are those who go to the extreme of wanting to be kidnapped by a real-life Massimo, a real disservice in times when consent is deservedly so exalted and discussed, but not exactly a surprise.Let it be said the series You, launched in 2018 on Netflix and flour from the same bag. Played by Penn Badgley, the protagonist Joe Goldberg became a kind of cult prince for the audience. With good-looking features and a literary baggage worthy of admiration, Joe would be truly charming, were he not an obsessive psychopath who chases his muses and does everything to have them as lovers - including killing. The character's romanticization was so absurd that Badgley was forced to make it clear on social media that Joe is a murderer, and that the point of the series is not to make anyone want to be kidnapped, but to see madness beyond a pretty face.The same cannot be said of 365 DNI, whose objective is, in fact, to make up the madness behind beautiful faces and paradisiacal landscapes. Below the minimum expected social responsibility, the film distorts any concept of consent. Massimo, several times, warns Laura that he will not do anything that she does not allow - except, of course, to keep her as a kind of property, with the right to violent actions and inappropriate touches, until she meets her sick desires. . If the kidnapping, by itself, is already problematic to make anything that follows unfeasible, there is still a scene in which he ties her to the armchair of his private jet, palpating her in inappropriate places with the clear intention of ""provoking her "". In another passage, Laura is immobilized on a bed straight out of Christian Gray's fetishes, in Fifty Shades of Gray, while being forced to watch another woman satisfy the kidnapper's sexual desires in order to show her what she is supposedly missing out on. be so resistant to giving yourself to the executioner.At this point, it was to be expected that scenes like these, which are so obvious they become caricatures, dispense with problematization. But given the frisson caused by the relationship on social networks, it is important to remember that drugging women, keeping them in captivity and touching them without their consent is not romantic, even when you own a sculptural body and millions in the bank . Ironically, who fulfills that role in the film is Laura's best friend, an expansive woman and portrayed caricatively as ""crazy"" who, although a losing vote, shows herself as close as the long dare to reach the voice of reason when stating that the friend is trapped in a golden cage, but still, she is a prisoner - symbolic phrase, whether she is with or without intention. In times when it is tried, at all costs, to educate women to recognize abuses, even if involved in apparent chivalry, it is symptomatic, and regrettable, that a film naturalizes in such a grotesque way everything that has been trying to fight. There is no romance in a kidnapping, and there is no beauty in the abuse, even though captivity is paradise island.Film seen on October 18, 2020."
92,"I became an official voter for the Razzies in 2020, not long before the world was devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, and with cinemas being closed, it meant that the nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards would include digital platform releases. This Polish film was one listed in the suggested films to be nominated for the awards, it was surrounded by a high amount of negativity and controversy, including for it to be removed from Netflix, so I watched it as soon as possible. Basically, during a meeting between the Torricelli Sicilian Mafia crime family and black-market dealers, Massimo Torricelli (Razzie nominated Michele Morrone) sees a beautiful woman on a beach. Moments later, Massimo and his father (Gianni Parisi), leader of the Sicilian Mafia family, are both shot by the dealers; Massimo survives while his father dies. Five years later, Massimo is now the leader of the Torricelli crime family. He is often urging to fulfil his sexual pleasure and can only be satisfied by women he hires to perform oral sex and other acts with him. In Warsaw, Laura Biel (Razzie nominated Anna-Maria Sieklucka), a beautiful sales director working in a luxurious hotel, is unhappy in her relationship with her boyfriend Martin (Mateusz Lasowski), and longing for sexual pleasure herself. Laura celebrates her 29th birthday in Italy, but after Martin embarrasses her, she goes for a walk and runs into Massimo, who kidnaps her. Laura finds herself being held captive at Massimo's villa. He reveals that she is the woman he saw on the beach when he was injured. He has been thinking about and searching for her for five years. Massimo tells Laura that he intends to keep her as a prisoner for 365 days until she falls in love with him. He also promises her that he will not touch her without her consent, whilst simultaneously having his hands around her throat and touching her. When Laura tries to escape, he does not let her leave. With no choice but to stay with him, she accepts and takes of advantage of the luxurious lifestyle. As they spend time together, Laura teases him and then refuses to have sex with him. However, she slowly starts to get him to open up about his personal life. At a hotel in Rome, she teases him again. Massimo cuffs her to the bed and forces her to watch him as he receives oral sex from another woman. Afterward, she appears to want to give in. But he releases her and orders her to get dressed for a night out. At the club, Massimo is angered as Laura flaunts herself in front of him and his friends. When she begins to flirt with a man from the rival mafia family, the man gropes her against her will. Massimo and the others draw their weapons while Laura is taken out of the club. The following morning, she wakes on a yacht to see Massimo and his fellow mafioso, Mario (Bronislaw Wroclawski), arguing. During the night, a mafia war between the two families has ignited, after Massimo shot the man who groped Laura in his hand. Laura attempts to apologise, but Massimo blames her for the incident. As they argue, Laura falls from the side into the water. Massimo jumps in and saves her. When she awakens, he admits he was scared she might not make it and does not want to lose her. Laura finally gives into her feelings and sexual desires, gives Massimo oral sex, before the proceed to make love on the bed, and numerous times in numerous positions in other places on the yacht. After a long time being incarcerated, Massimo allows Laura to visit her family in Warsaw. He tells her he loves her and will join her after finishing up business. In Warsaw, Laura waits for Massimo for days with no contact. She reconnects with her friend Olga (Magdalena Lamparska) and they go clubbing. At the club, she runs into Martin, who says he has been looking. He wants to apologise and reconcile. He follows her back to her apartment, where Massimo is unexpectedly waiting. After Martin leaves, they have sex, during which Laura sees wounds on Massimo's body, wounds from the mafia war. She confesses to him that she loves him. The next morning, Laura is surprised when Massimo proposes, to which she accepts. However, she tells him she wants him to keep his ""occupation"" a secret from her parents. Back in Italy, Mario informs Massimo of rising tensions. Laura mentions feeling unwell but decides not to see a doctor. They discuss their upcoming wedding, she does want her family to know what Massimo does, so they are not allowed to attend. However, Massimo allows Laura to invite Olga as her bridesmaid. When Olga visits, Laura tells her she is pregnant. Olga urges her to tell Massimo about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Mario receives a phone call from an informant that the rival mafia family has threatened to kill Laura. Laura and Olga are driving through the hills, and Laura's car enters a tunnel but does not come out the other side. Mario rushes to find Massimo just as Laura's call to him is cut off. Massimo breaks down, as it is implied Laura is dead, with police gathering at the entrance of the tunnel. Also starring Otar Saralidze as Domenico, Natasza Urbanska as Anna, Grazyna Szapolowska as Klara Biel, Laura's mother, and Tomasz Stockinger as Tomasz Biel, Laura's father. Morrone is good looking and Sieklucka is beautiful, there is only a little chemistry between them, the morality of the situation is concerning. The film has 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it is listed in the IMDb Bottom 100 list, and there is a petition to have it removed from Netflix. This is due to its sexual violence, and that it apparently is ""glorifying Stockholm Syndrome and abuse"". There was the slightest part of me that went along with it, being so ridiculous (I can see the comparison to Fifty Shades of Grey), the softcore porn style sex scenes and violence certainly get your attention, and maybe some songs in the soundtrack, but otherwise it is a dark and daft ""love"" story, a silly and unconvincing erotic romantic drama. It won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Barbara Bialowas, and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel (rip-off of Fifty Shades of Grey). Adequate!"
93,"Laura, from Warsaw, and her boyfriend head to Sicily for a holiday. There she meets Massimo, the young leader of a local Mafia family. He is immediately smitten by her and kidnaps her, takes her back to his estate and holds her captive. He gives her 365 days to fall in love with him.Incredibly bad: weak story, dull and wafer-thin plot. Doesn't work on any level.Not sure who the target audience is. If you want a good story, there isn't much of a plot. If you want a good gangster/crime drama, that element takes up maybe 5-10% of the movie. If you want a romantic drama: what part of a woman being kidnapped by a knuckle-headed hoodlum and yet somehow falling in love with him is romantic, or even plausible? If you want an erotic drama, this will only work if you're a teenager and/or you don't have access to the internet.I assume this was made to cash in on the inexplicable success of Fifty Shades of Grey. On that note, as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey is, 365 Days makes that look like a masterpiece."
94,One star for the movie's generous amount of pretty fun unintentionally comical sex scenes. And Michele Morrone please stop singing.
95,"I know that bunch of people like because they are fans of the actors or from marketing team. But in this case it is opposite because of Rhea, people gave it less rating. This movie is not a 10/10, but it's not 1/10 either. After watching this movie with very detailed focus I give this a 8/10 rating. I think this movie is a nice decent watch. Rhea's acting was little off, but every others acting was brilliant."
96,"EDIT: 3rd September 2021, IMDB ratings of this film stand at 7.2! SSR bots are probably burning somewhere in hell xDDDD!!First of all, i would request IMDB to remove these ssr fans reviews from their site as they are basically baseless ones (such immature stuff happens only in India)... well if you are mature enough you will review the film only after watchingNow coming to the film. The first half is quite tensed and interesting. You already know from the trailer that Emraan must have committed a crime hence all this drama still you would like to know how things proceed and what exactly he did to deserve this fate. Tensed and interesting conversations , thanks to an earnest starcast makes the convos interesting.The 2nd half is where the film becomes ordinary. Emraan's past reminds of his regular cassanova films with betrayal. And that past too is not a good one. Hence the 2nd half is a miss!Amitabh, Emraan, Dhritiman, Anu and Raghubir...these 5 legends make sure that the present part is watchable and interesting! Rhea plays a rather mysterious complex character and she's decent (at the least i would say..ok).Overall, a film that you can give a shot at (if you are not one of those immature ssr nibba-nibbi fan base member). Remember, the 2nd half is a little dissapointing but i think the overall film can be watched for it's performances and an interesting mock court sequence."
97,"Stuck in bad weather, hero seeks refuge in a house inhabited by 4 elderly men. They decide to play a game with him wherein they allege that he has murdered his boss n usurped his position. Hero is flummoxed and desperately tries to uphold his innocence but is unable to do so. What happens next? The premise is interesting but the narration isn't riveting. Too much time is lost before the story actually commences. Performances r good. Bachchan speaks very well, but he speaks too much. Running time needs to be reduced by 25 minutes. #Chehre rating 2.5/5."
98,"Four friends cum erstwhile court officials comprising a public prosecutor, defence lawyer, judge and an executioner, regroup at a heritage mansion in an isolated hill station. Reenacting mock trials on stranded strangers who seek refuge in their spooky house happens to be their favorite pastime. The game's fun until things get serious.Delhi bound ad agency chief Sameer Mehra (Emraan Hashmi) runs into the four gentlemen when he is compelled to spend the night at the house owing to extreme weather. He gets acquainted with the law veterans who are happy to host him. Amitabh Bachchan is the public prosecutor, Annu Kapoor is the defence lawyer, Dhritiman Chatterjee plays the judge and Raghubir Yadav the executioner. An unblinking Rhea Chakraborty who breaks into creepy bouts of laughter is Anna, the mansion's mysterious housekeeper-painter.Small talk and a brief drinking session later, Sameer eases into the senior citizen's club and agrees to indulge in the courtroom game coined by the four veterans. He finds it amusing until they accuse him of killing his boss and taking his position in the agency. The trial begins and the unravelling of Sameer's case forms the story. Will he be convicted or acquitted ?Ranjit Kapoor's story is inspired from Swiss writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt's acclaimed novel 'A Dangerous Game' and is very interesting and unique. Ranjit Kapoor and Rumy Jafry's screenplay is effective for most parts, especially in the first half.Chehre begins on a great note. Amitabh Bachchan's entry is clap worthy. The exchange of dialogues here is very smooth and convincing. The way Lateef manages to conclude that Sameer is a culprit through the power of his observation and experience of asking the correct questions keeps the interest going. The intermission point is shocking. The second half starts on an interesting note. The flashback of Sameer and Natasha (Krystle Dsouza) is refreshing as it gives audiences a break from the four-walls of the mansion where the film is set. Initially, it is captivating but towards the end of the flashback, the film becomes predictable. The twist in the very final scene of the film is quite impressive and helps the film to end on a fine note.Speaking of performances, Amitabh Bachchan as usual is excellent and suits the part. His dialogue-delivery is obviously commendable but he's very impressive in the scenes where he's simply observing and planning his next wise move. Emraan Hashmi is the surprise of the film. He has always been a great performer but here, he steals the show and stands up in front of the veteran actors. Also, he looks quite dashing. Annu Kapoor is dependable as always and its funny how he pronounces certain words and terms. Dhritiman Chatterjee has limited dialogues but leaves a mark. Raghubir Yadav has a unique look and adds to the madness, especially at the intermission point. Krystle Dsouza is another surprise of the film. Rhea Chakraborty (Anna) has an important part and initially, she appears a bit caricaturish. But then it becomes clear that her character is a bit mentally unstable. She is memorable in two scenes - one, where she almost stabs Emraan, and two, when Emraan asks her for the keys. Siddhant Kapoor (Joe) has no dialogues but speaks through his eyes. Samir Soni looks dull while Alexx O'Nell (Richard) gets no scope.Overall, Chehre is a engrossing movie with solid performances given by it's starcast."
99,"Flipping through that many critical scrutinies, I was preparing myself for nothing but another disappointment. Following my two hours spent with this execution, now I can tell with much certainty that my presumption was only half right.To start with; the set-up, the all-around ambiance is relatively straightforward and explicit with their motivations and purposes. The creators knew what they needed to accomplish, and they successfully did so up until the third act's commencement. Unfortunately for them, thereupon, everything had gone downhill.The primary justification for its eventual downfall is directly correlated to the Script's inability to uphold the rhythm, the momentum it was building up to, until the finale begins to take place. Just goes to show, how much important it is to wrap up on a decisive note. The closure is as crucial as the initiation!Speaking of performances, those are nice. Nothing out of the ordinary, but each member of the cast did their job with utmost commitment and sincerity. Amongst them, needless to say; Mr. Bacchan stands out the most and on the other end, Emraan Hashmi again showcases his capability to be able to play all kinds of personalities.At the end of the day, their goals might have been naive, unearthing the loopholes of our country's judiciary or the protocols themselves; but the way all that has been dealt with, it just doesn't quite hit the mark. Don't get me wrong, the underlying subtext holds grave significance and mustn't be disregarded but the timing wasn't relevant nor the strategy the film had seemingly taken in regards to that particular aspect."
