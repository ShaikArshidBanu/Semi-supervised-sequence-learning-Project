["Margot Robbie is the joker ... not the Joker, but like a joker. As in I love her so much, it is almost impossible for me to see a movie with her and not like it. Ok jokes aside, her character has finally some development here, in stark contrast to the Suicide Squad movie she was a part of.Concentrating on women is generally a good thing. The problem some may have is not that, but the cliches that will become quite apparent throughout the movie. Not to mention the sheer luck (or coincidence?) the main characters seem to have. If you don't mind this and are all for female (em)power(ment) and don't mind the one brush of character our bad guy has (Ewan McGregor is still quite amazing, even with so little to play with, no pun intended) ... you will have fun. Not everything has to be excellent ... still a long way to come back on top though"]
