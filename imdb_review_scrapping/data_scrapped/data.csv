"It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no ""Diamonds are Forever."" And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn't they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"Of course the James Bond spirit is not exactly the same as the other films over decades. It is more gloomy, darker, with a total different face of our hero. You have in this movie many unexpected things, but the overall scheme remains à James Bond movie, maybe more than SKYFALL, which was far far more a crime thriller than an OO7 feature. Watch it again and compare. In a way, SKYFALL announced this one, with SPECTRE in the middle. Not the best Bond ever, but not the worst either."
"""No Time to Die"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch James Bond living as a pensioner but this will change very soon. Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Léa Seydoux's who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek's who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes' who played as M. In conclusion, I have to say that ""No Time to Die"" is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of James Bond movies I am sure you will love it."
"I saw this with a friend who watched the original ""Dr. No"" (1962) at the time, and who proclaimed at the end of this 2¾ hour marathon that this just isn't ""James Bond"". My first ""Bond"" film was some fifteen years later but i was forced to agree with him. This isn't. I have never been the biggest fan of Daniel Craig - he completely lacks charisma on screen. There is no glint in his eye! Add to that the grim determination of the producers to rob the character of his flaws and foibles; to politically correct every aspect of the storylines and to generally sterilise what was always, essentially, a charming tale of light weight male chauvinism with espionage, shameless patriotism, gadgets, double entendre and a damn good theme tune. Here, Craig has precious little chemistry with either of his female co-stars and the baddie features so sparingly (though that maybe because he was double-jobbing for Lord Lloyd Webber at the Opera) that even by the end there just wasn't a sense of accumulated tension, peril or danger - indeed I just felt really quite underwhelmed. Of course, it is a fabulous looking film: the old Aston Martin makes a welcome return - as does the divine Louis Armstrong's ""All the Time in the World"" but I wonder how many of us will recall this film once the dust has settled. It has a role right now; it may well single-handedly rescue cinema from the horrible effects of lockdown, and for that is must be congratulated, but speaking as a lifelong Bond fan, I'd implore those at the helm of the next one: can we please get back to what Bond is entertaining at, what Ian Fleming designed him to be and stop imposing wafer-thin stories on equally thin, undercooked, characterisations and hope that nostalgia and John Barry et al will dupe us into thinking it is great? I don't care if the next 007 is gay/girl/coloured/one legged - but please can we get back to a story laced with humour and personality with a script that allows for nuance, sarcasm and charm. Otherwise, perhaps Bond has just served his purpose, it's time to move on? Sorry - I was really disappointed."

"I don't know why I bothered; I figured this would be a pointless Anglophone remake of the tense 2018 Danish thriller. I also don't know why this Nic Pizzolatto guy has his own screenwriting credit here when most of it's lifted straight from the original. I guess he's taking credit for the rearrangement of a scene that results in unnecessarily dragging out the resolution so that we may see Jake Gyllenhaal's puke in a toilet, or for adding that 2am phone call to the ex that just makes Gyllenhaal's Joe all the more unbearable, and let's not forget that time Joe gets up to get a cup of joe, and he's displeased there's not enough already made for him. What I've seen from director Antoine Fuqua, too, gives the impression of a hacky filmmaker. The Denzel Washington movies are entertaining enough, because Denzel Washington, but the rest of them.... ""Southpaw"" (2015), also starring Gyllenhaal, is an overrated melodrama. I have yet to see ""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016) remake, but I'm not looking forward to it.This seems to be sheer incompetence to me, as if they had no idea what worked in the original, and, Instead of adding a novel interpretation, just watered it down with generics. Gustav Möller's picture was a one-man variation on ""12 Angry Men"" (1957) with an emphasis on sound in the emergency phone calls. An intensely claustrophobic utilization of the artifice of cinema. So, of course, for the remake they begin with a Bible verse and helicopter shots to needlessly attempt thematic grandeur and paint the background with California wildfires. Also unnecessary dramatic scoring to blow the intensity and subtlety of the sound design. Gyllenhaal spends the first part in an enormous glass-filled tomb to International Style architecture with a series of big screen TVs for the wildfire background and multiple monitors for each dispatcher like we're watching a high-tech hacker or spy movie. Saving the spectator the hassle of having to use their own imagination by the movie visualizing what Joe sees in his mind listening to a couple calls is especially inept.Oh, and Gyllenhaal can't help himself with the histrionics. It's bad enough they gave him an asthma inhaler to work with. I really miss the beads of sweat rolling down Jakob Cedergren's brow during his pregnant pauses compared to Gyllenhaal's spray-on sweat and crocodile tears as he shouts belligerently and pounds on glass windows. There's nothing that quite lowers one's estimation of an actor than to see him do so much more poorly in the same role performed by another just a couple years ago. Ditto the other filmmakers. At least Washington seemed to realize what he got himself into with with Fuqua in ""Training Day"" (2001) and ""The Equalizer"" (2014) and so turned up the acting even more over-the-top than usual to deliver us a bounty of ham.I would think that an easy bar for whether a remake should exist would be that it improves on or differs from the original in at least one interesting way. Yet, this one is nonetheless guilty of failing that test. Oh well, at least it got me to watch the Danish original."
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningL. A. Police officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllengaal) has been demoted to working in an emergency call centre after an incident that created a scandal for the department. A seething ball of stress and frustration, with internalised demons knawing away at him, things take a turn when he answers an emergency call from Emily (Riley Keough) who says her and her son are trapped in a vehicle with Henry (Peter Saarsgard), her partner who's suffering a psychotic episode. Joe seems to have been offered a shot at redemption, but things may not be as they seem...We've already had the release of the Candyman remake in theatres in recent times, launching Nia Da Costa on to becoming the female director with the highest grossing film of all time under her belt, and now Netflix have released this highly publicised remake of a superb Danish film from just a couple of years ago, with Hollywood star Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead. American remake of foreign language film doesn't make for a promising outcome in general, but with a reliable, assured cast and crew at hand, The Guilty is a rare exception.Established director Antoine Fuqua is no amateur, and doesn't allow his vision of the original film to become 'Americanised' in any way, taking great care not to overblow or sensationalise anything as so many are prone to, and instead faithfully recreating the isolated atmosphere and feeling of claustrophobia in the continuous ninety minutes of real time we spend in the remote but high pressure and highly stressful environment of the 911 call centre. Gyllenhaal, in the lead, projects a compressed intensity, occasionally spoiled by a lack of restraint with some explosive outbursts, while in roles where we only hear their voices, Keough and Saarsgard capture a sense of vulnerability and desperation.It can't escape its trappings as a remake of a great film, still fresh itself in everyone's mind, but it's highly faithful and unpretentious, still managing to be as suspenseful and human as the original, even if it's not quite as good. ****"
"This film is very intense, especially given the fact that it's a single location one man show. The twist is very powerful, and sends shiver down my spine."
30 minutes in and you realize that you do not care about either the main character or the problem he is trying to solve. Jake does his best but that is not enough.
"Awesome single-location movie, keeps you glued to the screen and emotionally invested throughout. The performance by jake gyllenhaal is phenomenal, no surprise. But man it really drives this movie and elevates it significantly. The story comes together very well with a fully satisfying conclusion (1 viewing, 10/11/2021)"
"Was a big watcher of ""HBO's"" series ""The Sopranos"" never missed an episode of it, so I for sure checked out this movie prequel from creator David Chase called ""The Many Saints of Newark"". Here it goes back in time to the 60's in Newark when Tony was a little boy and this origin story shows how Tony was developed into a crime lord king with help and being guided by his mentor Dickie Moltisanti(the good Alessandro Nivola) the film borders on drama and Greek tragedy as Tony deals with pain and power struggle as you see the past and how the characters were made and connected. Uncle Jr., Paulie, and Silvio are all shown in their early crime days, plus stubborn and hard headed Livia Soprano(Vera Farmiga) is shown belittling life and trying to wrap her son down. As Tony(in a fine performance from the late James Gandolfini's son Michael) grows it's interesting to see how crime and family drama is all around him with his life and times including gang wars and riots call it what you want mob drama or origin tale this is a must watch for any ""Sopranos"" fan as it sheds insights into the past and the start of how the iconic Tony Soprano came about."
"Having the son of Gandolfini play a young version of Tony Soprano ... I don't think this can get any more meta than that. And while I was not aware while I watched the movie of that fact, it felt eerie how he looked a lot like James Gandolfini. Well now I know why ... and while some may cry nepotism, I urge you to not do that - because it is not just the looks that work here! His acting abilities seems to match that of his father - well after one movie, I should not judge prematurely of course. The likelihood is there that he can also become at least a good actor.But it is not just the son of Gandolfini here ... while the opening shot plays during the run of the Sopranos show (and I seriously have to rewatch the movie and the tv show together), the movie itself plays way in the past. And it plays way differently than the tv show did. So if you just expect this to be a longer Sopranos episode ... you may dissapointed. But I have a feeling that anyone who loves the Sopranos, will understand that this is a different beast ... or beasts! No pun intended.So many good actors in this and a lot of hints to things to come ... in the tv show. In fact so many that I am likely to have missed at least half of them. If the shows creator was able to do this and bring this to life, he is the one who will know every single one of them.Really well created, acted, shot, edited and whatever else you can think of. Only thing I'm not entirely sure of: should you watch this first if you haven't seen the tv show or the Sopranos first and then the movie? But there are issues that one might not have a problem with having ... I say you decide ... hearing some in the sneak preview I was in talk about this being based on a tv show was almost comical. But also goes to show you that the Sopranos are still in everyones mind .. even the people who've never seen it ..."
"I loved the Sopranos . I watched it religiously and followed the exploits of Tony Soprano and his friends and family religiously, so when the trailer for The Many Saints of Newark popped up , I was really excited but did the movie live up to my expectations?Not really .The film reveals the humanity behind Tony's struggles and the influence his family - especially his uncle, Dickie Moltisanti - had over him becoming the most iconic TV mob boss of all time.Don't get me wrong , I enjoyed this film but for me , it never really took off.It actually feels like the Prequel to a prequel.What I mean by that is , it sets the viewer up for what it to come in Anthony Sopranos life and maybe we will see that in the next film .This is all about Tony's Uncle Dickie Moltisanti .A man who will kill family members without thinking. He oozes charisma and that has an affect on Tony .It's good to see some characters from the TV show as younger people and it's done very well . Especially Vera Farmiga who plays Livia Soprano. She gets her personality spot on.Ray Liota is great too .Michael Gandolfini who plays Tony Soprano ( James Gandolfini's actual son ) isn't convincing enough in the role and at no time did I feel he was the Tony from the TV show .The main problem is the story isn't interesting enough. It's a typical gangster style film with the cliched set pieces and that's fine but I wanted a little bit more .All in all the film had great characters and cast but the story felt flat .Let's hope the next one is more dynamic."
"I think I'm right in saying that this is another one of the films that is going to open on ""HBO Max"" in the States, rather than widely at the cinema. Here in the UK, we have had a cinematic release and as a fan of ""The Sopranos"" I jumped at the chance go. Though I wouldn't go as far as to say I was disappointed, I came away unsure as to the point of what I'd seen.Richard Moltisanti (Allesandro Nivola) is a gangster, running numbers and trafficking stolen goods in Newark. Initially struggling to conceive a child of his own, he acts like a second father to the son of his friend Johnny Boy Soprano (Jon Bernthal). Young Tony (William Ludwig/Michael Gandolfini) has an unstable homelife and is beginning to act out at school. Dickie Moltisanti has other issues though, such as the rise of black gangs in the neighbourhood following the riots of 1967 and his attraction to his father's young new wife, Giuseppina (Michela De Rossi).It's not that this is bad. By no means is it bad. The performances are excellent, the impressions of established characters are nicely done, the recreation of the 1960's and 1970's is really well done. It's that I felt like I was watching what should have been at least three seasons of television, with the fast forward button on. It's interesting to see that this is being sold as ""The formative years of Tony Soprano"" when really that's quite a small part of the overall film, barely even a third of it, I'd say. It's very much the Dickie Moltisanti story, narrated from beyond the grave, by his son. It's his relations that make up the bulk of the story and not just his relationship with Tony, but also with his father played by Ray Liotta, his new step mother, a low level runner called Harold McBrayer, played by Leslie Odom Jr and with the rest of the family - both actual and metaphorical.There are quite a few different plot points to the film, but all are shallowly dealt with as they only have two hours to play out, rather than thirty. It's like watching a wrap up film for a cancelled TV show where the writers say, ""this is where we would have gone"". None of the betrayals or murders play that heavy as we don't spend enough time with the characters to get more than a basic feel about who they are.Again, I don't want to bang on as if what's here isn't good. It is, and I really hope if finally allows Allesandro Nivola to get some meatier roles again, and, on the smaller screen, it might seem more fitting than it does at the Cinema. But I came away wishing I could have the rest of this, rather than just the tiny taster menu that was on offer."
"The Many Saints of Newark is a crime drama serving as a prequel to the series The Sopranos. Even if you aren't familiar with the series, this film is certainly worth a try for genre fans.The movie revolves around the childhood and adolescence of Tony Soprano, the child of an American-Italian crime family. He explores betrayal and loyalty, doubts and trust, joy and sorrow, embitterment and reconciliation, life and death among family members and friends.This film convinces on many levels. First of all, the soundtrack, settings and clothings bring the sixties and seventies back to life in authentic fashion and provide atmospheric depth.Up next, the different characters are very distinctive and profound. We observe innocent children looking up to their family members, frustrated mobsters who are attempting to gain freedom, influence and reputation and old-fashioned gangsters who don't make any compromises and don't take any prisoners.The movie features several subplots which add much diversity. It follows the complicated relationship of an Italian immigrant with her violent husband, a mobster who has to go to prison and leave his family behind for four years and a family man who makes many enemies while trying to become the leader of the mobsters.However, there are also a few elements that could have been improved. Some characters could have been given some additional background information in form of flashbacks.Up next, the movie mostly focuses on dialogues but a few more explosive scenes might have added some action and tension at appropriate times.Still, The Many Saints of Newark is a good to very good gangster movie that can compete with other recent releases such as The Irishman. The atmosphere, characters and subplots are certainly the highlights and leave room for potential sequels. Newcomers might be interested in watching the television series as well after discovering this film while fans of the series might think that the movie is at times lacking depth and precision. If you like this kind of movie, let me warmly recommend you the similar Mafia Inc. Released two years ago in Quebec."
"Venom: Let Their Be CarnageOver this movie was good not great, of course the first Venom was so brilliant it was a hard act to follow, and maniacal scientist is difficult to beat. Well this time they went with Woody Harrelson who played a deranged serial killer, good but not quite equal adversary of Venom.What were the problems,The story was thin, very thin, I never ceases to amaze me how studios run with an idea when a classroom of 14 year olds would come up with 20 better suggestions that were more imaginative.Unfortunately there was a lot of style over substance.Venom's adversary needs to be majorly different from him for variety.Stop introducing the same characters, believe me the viewing audience can cope with change.Overall I really liked the movie and it was Tom Hardy that I really liked, the rest was mostly padding in a continuation of the first movie. However it was well worth seeing, I'm giving this a firm 6 outta 10."
"Marvel and DC these days remind me of those big players of the worldwide cheeseburger ""distribution network"" - the products always taste the same, because the ingredients are always accurately of the same nature and made the same way. Always. The same applies these days to those entertainment companies - you already know what to expect if a new show or movie leaves the factories of those big players of genetic movie engineering. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is not a candidate for the worst movie categories nor a total bore or fail, it is just a part of that endless and constant stream of ""entertainment"" these factories produce: easy to consume, easy to forget. Long gone are the times when I heard people talking about a new movie or show of those ""big"" players. Disappointed? No, it's just business as usual."
"I like Venom: Let There Be Carnage because it is based on one of my favorite Marvel characters, Venom. I like that Carnage is a product of Venom, so watching these monsters clashing with each other is phenomenal.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is about a journalist named Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) who has a dark black, Spiderman looking devil named Venom that lives inside his body. Most of the movie shows Eddie and Venom not getting along, because Eddie is sick and tired of having Venom inside his body and Venom wants to be free to eat people. Venom is very clumsy and destructive and Eddie is frustrated because his apartment is a mess. An assassin named Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) knows Eddie and asks to speak to him before his death sentence is carried out. Eddie visits Cletus in prison, but Cletus antagonizes Eddie with his past and Venom comes out of Eddie's body to choke Cletus. Cletus bites Eddie's hand and tastes Venom's blood. So guess what happens? You have to watch the film to find out.This film has amazing CGI graphics. The graphics look so real and the buildings falling apart when Venom climbs between them look real as well. The fighting scenes between these two titans are so incredible that it makes you want to see more. I expected there to be more encounters between Venom and Carnage and was disappointed that there weren't more. The movie has a good combination of comedy and action. The music is appealing in every scene. My favorite part is, of course, the battle between Venom and Carnage in the church. Carnage is huge compared to Venom and looks more powerful than him because Carnage has multiple extremities which Venom does not have.The moral of this film is to never underestimate yourself no matter your size or strength. You do not know if you can win the war if you don't go to battle.I give Venom: Let There Be Carnage 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. This movie is available in theatres Friday, October 1, 2021. Tremember, like all Marvel movies, you have to wait until after the credits for a huge bonus. You have to stay seated for this one! By Ethan P., KIDS FIRST!"

"When we got to the climax and it felt like the movie just breezed by, I immediately added another star to my rating. A short super(anti)hero movie? AMAZING!Venom: Let There Be Carnage isn't a great movie and has ALL the clichés of most superhero movies, but it was enjoyable. I found myself laughing a lot at Venom's one-liners and again, I enjoyed how SWIFT this movie was. That was refreshing.Despite some exposition, this is one of those sequels YOU MUST see the first one to understand this universe. And that's too bad. I rated the first one 2/5 stars and didn't care for it much. This is absolutely the better of the two.Eddie Brock & Co. - or the alien symbiote, Venom - are still fighting over superiority when they have a break-up. Simultaneously, the guy who used to bartend at Cheers turns into both a supervillain and Venom's greatest foe. Will Eddie make up with Venom in time to stop the Carnage?Yes, this movie has the age-old Superhero trope I hate so dearly: ""I don't wanna be a superhero anymore! I quit!"" usually found in the second chapter. Superman II did it, The Dark Knight did it, Iron Man 2 did it, hell, Spider-Man 2 did it, just to name a few of hundreds of examples. I hate it with a passion. So, when it happened here, I tried to remain calm. Mercifully, when Venom's on his own, he does have some fantastic and hilarious scenes. This one gets a pass because we hardly ever get to see the other side of this equation. All we usually get is the whiney non-superhero.That and some of the lazy writing's are probably the most problems of this. Everything else was fine or actually good. No one was terrible and the special effects were 10x better than the original. Recommended.***Final Thoughts: My friend with me said: We have to wait for the mid-credit scene. The second he told me that, I knew 100% who was showing up. Despite that, listen to my friend. You need to see it."
"Denis Villeneuve is not a bad director; but has a really pacing issue. Most of his movies like The Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 over welcome their stay. Both of them could have been far better with some minutes less and more focus on the main story.DUNE makes exactly the same mistake; most of the movie is in David Lean mode (Lawrence of Arabia) with too long takes on the desert, on the rocks or deep dramatic and profound looks of the main characters. Adding to the agony; the very confusing dreams or visions; and about a 1000 takes of Zedaya digitally enhanced blue eyes; there is very little time left in the two and half hours to complete properly the story. Solution; trust people to see the older movies, the tv series or read the book and take out essential parts. The Baron other nephew (Feyd), the Emperor and his daughter or transport union creatures are nowhere to be seen.The conflict of interest is barely explained in a few lines of dialog; the Duke achievements with the Fremen are not given any importance.A friend of mine, not familiar with the above, ask me what was happening and who were some of the characters; so do not expect to understand most of it if you are not familiar.In the acting department; Chamalet is fine but he does not look as a rebel fighter; more as a scared young boy some mother issues. Fergusson however is very good she even survives her many many face close-ups.For those who complained about Lynch's 1984; in this one story is the basically same but with slower pace. Lynch made a more compelling first part in 60 minutes with far easy to understand and with more character development than the 150 minutes in the new version. The only noticeable difference; the insinuation of some complot from the Bene Gesserit with Jessica involvement.Last but not least; while the visuals are too spectacular; action scenes are not and with little or not emotion.In brief; better visuals but not much more than the old movie and the series."
"'Dune' is a stunning, gourgeous looking Sci-fi Epic that faithfully adapts source material into the Big screen with class and craft. Villeneuve shows why he is a masterful filmmaker. This movie deserves to be witness in the biggest screen with the loudest sound system possible, not on TV. Because of its impressive photography and scenography. Because of the scoop of its ambition captured in widescreen shots. Because of a gargantum score by Hans Zimmer that will stay with you long after listening it. It has minor flaws: some characters are more glorified cameos without a proper storyline. But with all the things that could have gone wrong with this movie, that's a flaw easily forgettable. And this is world so Big, so ambitious that as Zendaya says closing the movie: ""This is only the beginning"".Warner, don't be stupid and make Part II as soon as possible. I want to see how this story goes further."

"I have seen many reviewers write that this movies has no ending. That's true. BUT: The ending Denis chose seems perfect to me. There is no cliffhanger, no big question that I needed immediate answers to. This movie is about house Atreides being betrayed and the path this sets Paul on. This path leads him to his new home: Arrakis.In that sense, this movie had enough of an ending for me to not feel dissatisfied.That said, I will probably go and read the book instead of waiting 3 years (or forever) for the conclusion of this story arc.This is a movie of gigantic scale that feels so familiar, yet so fresh and and unique in it's own way. It's a 2.5 hour, polished piece of art and spectacle.I cannot recommend it more, and if you're hesitant because it's just part 1, don't be.I would give this an easy 9.5/10."
"When Momoa and Oscar Isaac Is the only actor that can lift a scene, there's just something wrong.There's so many great, Lesser known actors that Denis could have picked for the roles. That was always the best part of His other movies.So why This A-List?? An A-List with mostly boring actors. That hasn't really made anything relevant In years. Vikander on the other hand would fit the role/love interest like a glove. Even A-List Natalie Portman would have been eyecandy.The bad:
Looking at you (Goonies) His only great movie.Or swedish rebecca Or Stellan, Even If I like her She just doesn't fit the part. And Stellan just overracts every scene.Nobody likes Javier bardem movies ever. Except the philosophical moviegooers that tries hard to find anything subtle to like about him.And Timothy looks like a 10 year old dude still going First year high school.As so many others I had High hopes for Dune.I had my own vision what It would look Like.I never been this hyped or been going to the cinema Since Bladerunner. So Yeah, Dune Is definitely a letdown In many ways. It feels like Denis Is allready going the Ridley Scott route, more cgi, less interesting ensemble, and.. worst part.. not even the Score Is that memorable In a sea of Ambient Masters that could easily made It more interesting, more otherwordly and melancolic epic.Dont get me wrong, I loved bladerunner, I was In Awe! I was telling people every chance I got to go watch Bladerunner! While modern practical effects movies Fade away to full cgi Marvel movies and terrible sequels that looks like videogames.. I freakn loved Bladerunner. When others did Not. When others didn't get It. Now.. most of DUNE has become what I feared. Still It's plenty more rich In detail and Ideas then whatever blockbuster that comes next. Dune Is bladerunner If ridley Scott directed a sequel full of cgi rendering. Its what the people are comfortable with today."
"Ryan Reynolds is a non-player character in a shooter game, a teller at a bank which is robbed several times a day. His best friend is bank guard Lil Rel Howery and they love Free City, and their lives. Their world is divided into their peers and the godlike ""people with sunglasses"", who are the avatars of players. Then one day Reynolds spots Jodie Comer in sunglasses, and wants to talk with her. When he does, he catches a glimpse of the reality behind his existence and does the unthinkable. He steps outside the narrow paths of his existence and becomes a hero.It's not the first time this theme has come up in movies or even drama. What, after all, is Pirandello's SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, or Hubbard's TYPEWRITER IN THE SKY, but examinations of fate versus free will? Yes, this romantic comedy version of the fantasy wears its symbolic message, that we don't have to accept fate, that we can choose to be heroes and champions of kindness and life, a little too obviously to please me. Even so, its unfailing good humor, kindly disposition and great CGI won me over as a great popcorn movie. With Taika Waititi and a host of current stars in cameos."
4 out of 5 stars.Free Guy is a good action comedy film about a non player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who breaks away from his routine in a video game world. And tries to follow a girl played by Jodie Comer. Who has her own hidden agenda.Great plot. The film has a tone like Wreck it Ralph or Ready Player One. The film is a lot of fun. Has lots of big and loud action. And lots of fun humor that is driven by Ryan Reynolds.Great cast ensemble. The movie could have took more use of adding more soundtrack that could have worked. But has the bare minimum. The movie does have a lot of fun cameos which is funny. And other references to other franchises. Which made the movie great.
"Blue shirt Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is an NPC that does the same thing everyday. When he sees a female player he goes out of character to meet her. It seems the program has an AI algorithm that allows the characters to develop. This turns his world upside down.There have been films with characters in games interacting with humans. Tron was the forerunner to all of this. There were numerous low budget films and who didn't fall in love with ""Glitch."" This film was fresh and funny. And like all great films, it was also a love story."
"Free GuyGuy wakes up every morning, greets his goldfish, eats his cereal, gets the same coffee from the same barista (it's always too hot), greets his security guard friend as they walk to the bank where they work, all while armed robberies, car chases, helicopter crashes etc. Are going on around them. And thisis not odd, because Guy is an NPC - a non-playable character - in the online videogame Free City. He is essentially walking scenery, programmed with a specific set of behaviour. But then he starts to wonder where there might be more to life, and notices a girl (wearing sunglasses, indicating there is a real person behind her although Guy doesn't know this) and things begin to get interesting.All the above is made clear in the trailer, and there is a great deal of fun to be had from Guy breaking out of his programming and discovering the consequences of being in a videogame. But there is a whole additional plot going on which carries some genuine drama on at least two plotlines, adding weight to what would otherwise be a fun but silly piece.Ryan Reynolds' air of affable geniality with a touch of hunk suits Guy perfectly. The film has a great story (especially for games and nerds generally), is often very funny, has fantastic special effects and also a surprising amount of heart. Plus there is a great call-out to - never mind, I really don't want to spoil it."
"I did play GTA III on the PS2 many years ago. So the free wheeling world of Free Guy had some familiarity.From the initial scenes where it is noticeable mainly due to lack of product placement and branding. Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a bank teller, Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) the bank security guard live in a virtual world.Guy realizes that he is actually an NPC (non player character) in Free City, an online video game. His artificial intelligence kicks in when he meets Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer.)In the real world, Millie (Jodie Comer) is suing software developer Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing the code developed by her and Keys (Joe Keery.)Somewhere in the game is the evidence that Antwan is the software thief.Free Guy is an action comedy that relies on the effortless charm of Reynolds. It riffs movies like Ready Player One, Truman Show even The Matrix.Disney who now owns 20th Century Studios even mine their properties ranging from Marvel to Star Wars which is also reminiscent of Ready Player One.It is a fun movie, although I'm sure Keys could had mentioned to his fellow workers much earlier that Antwan was a heel who had stolen the code."
"I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing. There are a few funny jokes to balance the film too. The scene with Florence Pugh posing made the cinema laughed out loud. I really enjoyed this film."
"Scarlett Johansson is the super-heroine of the film 'Black Widow' directed by Cate Shortland and released on screens this summer (2021) with a delay of one year due, of course, to the pandemic. The film's producers (including Scarlett) have decided to postpone the release until the audience returns to theatres. Commercially, I think the decision was inspired, and the film, benefiting from the passion of the genre's fans after a year of abstinence, was devoured by those who were able to reach the cinema halls, and by those who accessed it on streaming. So Scarlett did her duty on screen as Natasha Romanoff, one of the super-heroines of the Avengers cycle returned from the death that had taken place in a previous series, and in the successful campaign to promote the film. Enthusiasts of the genre have passionately discussed how 'Black Widow' fits into the 'Marvel Universe', as an intermediate story between two series already released many years ago and a prelude to a sequel (or more) to appear in future. Fans less familiar or unfamiliar with comics-inspired movies have received a spectacular action movie, with a few original elements and quite a few other issues that they are not willing to forget as easily as fans do.I'm not a fan of comic books and Marvel heroes are unfamiliar to me. So I can only judge what I saw, being aware that I miss many of the details. 'Black Widow' starts very promising. The lives of a middle-class American couple in Ohio and of their kid daughters are abruptly interrupted when the parents, Russian (ex-Soviet actually as the event took place in 1995) agents, have to flee instantly because their cover has been blown-up. They arrive in Cuba and the girls are traumatically separated from their parents, who turns out to be not even their real parents. There are intense scenes, related to the real world and feelings with which we can resonate. Unfortunately, the only ones. Jump in time, 21 years later. We understand that the two girls followed 'special' programs that turned them into ruthless killers, even endowed them with supernatural powers, and now belong to different camps of the geopolitical wars. Destiny reunites the two, and later with their 'cover' parents in a mission that I will not say about more than that it is, of course, about saving the world or something like that of the effects of a red-coloured powder that annihilates the power of decision and turn humans into robots subject to any order. Half of the film is action scenes, the other half the tribulations of the reunited family, which was not a real family, but is still brought together by the values of the struggle for good and truth. (I try to be as serious as I can when I write this!)It is a film inspired by comics and the characters have a depth equal to the thinness of the sheet of paper on which they are drawn. The exception is Natasha, the character played by Scarlett Johansson (an actress I really like) and allow me to appreciate that this is one of her good roles at a time when her choices have raised many questions for me. But the superheroes can't afford to hesitate and doubt, and the film is, I think, a kind of handover within the series from Natasha to her sister Yelena, played by Florence Pugh, a British actress I see for the first time, talented and beautiful, but who will have to prove that she is able to carry the weight of films with the same aplomb as the magnetic Johansson. There is also an avalanche of feminist messages in this film directed by Cate Shortland, an Australian director with films of completely different genres in her record so far. All the heroines that matter are female, men are either bad guys or, in case they are not bad, they are ridiculous. Too explicit to be effective. 'Wonder Woman', for example, promotes the same kind of ideas, but makes it much more elegant. I can't say that I ended up watching 'Black Widow' too disappointed. As an informed spectator I knew what to expect. Excellent made technically, with captivating action scenes, the film will appeal to fans of action movies, and especially those inspired by comics. Experts in the 'Marvel Universe' will have new topics to debate for a long time to come. The rest of us we spent a couple of pleasant hours or so watching, and we'll quickly forget about everything we saw."
"It's 1995 Ohio. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), and their 'daughters' Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova are a Russian sleeper cell working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone). 21 years later after the events of Civil War, Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run. She goes for a safe house in Budapest where she runs into Yelena (Florence Pugh).The good part of this movie is introducing the 'family' into the Marvel universe. They are a surprisingly fun group. I was not expecting comedy. As for the plot, it's a standard James Bond plot. It's fine. It's able to fill in some of Natasha's history. It crosses a few items off the Marvel checklist. It could be better. It's obvious that the family is coming back in future Marvel stuff and that has good potential. I'm still not a fan of bringing Elaine into the Marvel world but that's a different rant altogether."
"You both have killed so many people. Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red. I couldn't be more proud of you.' Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour): to Natasha and YelenaWhat helps me through the bombs and kicks of super-hero films is the consistent ""family"" theme. It may be whole families or individual members looking for parents or siblings. In Black Widow, Natasha (Scarlett Johannson) is seeking reconciliation with her sister and her parents. BW frames the entire adventure around the family dynamic. Notwithstanding the combative family of Avenger superheroes themselves, this version brings home the importance of real home.Although Black Widow is historically placed between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, it has its own surfeit of mano-mano fighting and explosions. When the dust settles, Natasha joins forces with her sister, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) to find her mother, Melina (Rachel Weisz), and father, Alexei (David Harbour). Things are not as they seem when the daughters do catch up to join forces after some rocky initial actions.The first forty minutes of the family's escape from their idyllic Ohio home are as exciting an opener as you will likely see this summer. Then, as the formula demands, there is a Bond-like megalomaniac, Dreykov (Ray Winstone), whom the girls will target as he dominates other ""widows"" around the world with chemically-induced mind control.Twenty-one years later, Natasha escapes a SWAT team to Norway, then briefly rejoining Yelena in Budapest before they both try to evade an armored vehicle and the menacing Dreykov soldiers who mimic the fighting techniques of their prey-even Avengers.The vials of antidote Yelena steals were designed by Dreykov to erase free will of the world's widows-a McGuffin-like device that is lost amid the chaos. The nice touch is that the sisters not only can knock off this world enemy, but they can also liberate strong young women, a gentle way of introducing the feminist motif without beating the audience with it. After quite capable director Cate Shortland and writer Eric Pearson allow the sisters to reconcile, watch for Yelena mocking Natasha's balletic hair-toss pose. Not all the impact of the heroic epic is explosions.Johansson and Pugh are in the Butch Cassady tradition of buddy bonding, a characterizing that promises future Avengers' sagas to be more humane and endearing. BW is solid summer fun either at the theater or on Disney+."

"It was good. So far, it's in my top10 list of 2021 movies. However, I wasn't rly hooked up, jokes seemed to be outdated, some scenes were rushed. I liked visuals but that's it, I expected more from Marvel."
"Disney/Marvel has been applauded for its ethnic diversity in their superhero movies.There is a danger that it could evolve into a cookie cutter approach. Take the easy way out and follow the Black Panther formula.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does ride that wave.Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is a slacker in San Francisco parking cars along with best friend Katy (Awkwafina.) Both live an easy lifestyle that involves hard partying. Their other friends have settled down and gone for career goals.For Shaun everything changes when he is attacked one day on the bus. Katy discovers that Shaun has some whip smart martial arts moves.Shaun believes that his father Wenwu a notorious gangster has sent the goons. His sister might also be in danger and flies off to find her.Indeed Wenwu is an infamous and long lived immortal thanks to the Ten Rings. He changed his bad ways when he met and married a woman from a mystical land called Tal-Lo which is in another dimension.Now Wenwu wants to be reunited with his children and go to Tal-Lo to free their mother who he believes is calling out to him. It might be a trap.As in Black Widow, the Marvel Universe is building up to its next phase of superheroes and villains. You sense that there is more to come and again this feels low stakes.Several characters pop in from previous Marvel movies. Liverpool FC is the soccer team of choice for Marvel.There is some balletic martial arts sequences and some inspired Jackie Chan type moves.However the shadow of Black Panther is not far away. The finale is too CGI heavy and it turns into a Godzilla monster on monster type bash with elements of Dune."
"Action great (except cacophonous dragon fight), acting decent, visuals good, story predictable...the whole this is fine, but I have a more pressing matter to address here. I have yet to watch an MCU movie and felt like I got enough Wong. More Wong. Always more Wong."
"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth itWOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimesAnother frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnnafter endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. WowAll in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to! (3 viewings, 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021)"
"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time."
"Although 'Casino Royale' is often considered the best Daniel Craig Bond film, my personal favourite is actually 'Skyfall'. That said, 'Casino Royale', after liking it well enough, fared much better on re-watch. 'Quantum of Solace' however was a major disappointment, and for me deserves its distinction as one of the worst of the series.While the James Bond series has had its highs and lows, most of the films have been very enjoyable. At least three or four of Sean Connery's Bond films are among the best of the series (my personal favourite of the lot being 'Goldfinger'), with the only big misfire being 'Diamonds are Forever', despite one of the series' greatest theme songs. 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is also very good'. Roger Moore's films are mostly entertaining enough, though for me the only great one was 'The Spy Who Loved Me', with 'A View to a Kill' and 'Octopussy' (an unpopular opinion though) being two of the series' weakest. Wasn't crazy about Timothy Dalton's two entries, 'The Living Daylights' is the better of the two but is only decent. Pierce Brosnan's are not very popular with some Bond fans, for this viewer they're not bad; loved 'Goldeneye' and 'The World is Not Enough', liked 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and while 'Die Another Day' has enormous problems (especially Madonna's theme song being in the top 5 worst Bond themes, some cringe-worthy puns, over-silliness in the second half and an overload of CGI that was also pretty awful), I don't consider it that irredeemably bad, because it started off strongly and most of the performances were good, especially from Brosnan, Dench, Youn, Cleese and Pike, the only real sore spot being Madonna's cameo.Starting with what is good about 'Spectre' it is mostly very stylishly made with great use of atmospheric and beautiful locations. Some of the action sequences are exciting, particularly the train sequence and the supercar chase through Rome. The Mexico City pre-credits sequence is also pretty epic. Sam Mendes' direction has its moments, with evidence of style, elegance and thrills. There are also some good performances. Daniel Craig is as charismatic and debonair as ever, handling the dramatic and action moments well, though there was a slight sense of him starting to get bored of the role (nowhere near as bad as Connery in 'Diamonds are Forever' though). Christoph Waltz is very good- if also rather underused- as the main villain, a role that suits him to the ground, playing him with smarmy, sinister relish. Ralph Fiennes is enjoyably starchy, David Bautista conveys some menace as assassin Hinx and Ben Whishaw brings genuine spark to Q.However, for me, and other viewers too, 'Spectre' does suffer from some major problems. It particularly suffers from a confused tone, with a mix of violent action, humour with in the in-jokes and spy clichés, thriller and romance. While there are moments like some fun to spot references, neither component come off consistently or even that successfully. A good deal of the action is overblown and cartoonish rather than exciting (only the Rome chase and train sequence are memorable), with some the violence gratuitous. The humour is misplaced and border on parody that would have been more at home in something like 'Austin Powers'. The thriller elements do lack suspense and tension, due to parts that feel too recycled which gave it a real over-familiarity. Lastly, the romance is not interesting or developed at all, and has no natural or obvious chemistry.Léa Seydoux is a rather vapid Bond girl with very little to her, while Monica Bellucci is pretty much wasted in a too-brief appearance. Hinx is for personal tastes rather underwritten, but David Bautista does do what he can and as said conveys some menace. Andrew Scott's C is an obnoxious character and played every bit as obnoxiously. The film is far too long by half an hour, drags in the second half, ends ridiculously and anti-climactically and contains a muddled script with clumsy over-congratulatory in-jokes and hackneyed, dreary dialogue and feels very overblown in places. Mendes shows a gift for visual style and drama but forgets the suspense and tension unfortunately, while the editing (though not as bad as 'Quantum of Solace') is enough to make one confused and seasick. Thomas Newman's score is somewhat repetitive, and Sam Smith's theme song- like most- did absolutely nothing for me and one of the most undeserved Oscar wins in recent years, for me it is certainly the most undeserved in the category that there's been too and one of my least favourite Bond themes. It's ballad-like feel is at odds with the style of the rest of the film and feels like there are more than one climax that never happens when it's meant to. Smith's singing does not fit the song either, it's a song that sounds like it requires a more powerful voice and more emotional connection, the falsetto (a sound and technique that in all honesty I've never liked) was completely out of place as well and made Smith sound like a wimp.All in all, not as awful as it has been made out, and it is a better film than 'Quantum of Solace' but disappointing (especially with 'Skyfall' having been so good) and Craig's second weakest Bond. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"""Spectre"" is the newest entry to the long-running and successful James Bond franchise. It is Daniel Craig's 4th turn as the world's most famous agent and the second time for Sam Mendes as director. The movie takes place basically right after the end of ""Skyfall"" and there are several references back to this 3rd Daniel Craig Bond film, but also to the two films before that, mostly about Vesper Lynd, but also about LeChiffre. Judi Dench has a brief scene as M again and we find out what happened to Mr. White. But now that I mentioned M, let's elaborate a bit on that. Ralph Fiennes is back in the role and he is a very different M than all the ones before him. He actually keeps firing and fighting, something you totally wouldn't expect if you knew these characters from the old movies sitting behind their desk from 8 to 5. Then again, Fiennes' M has some kind of military background if I remember ""Skyfall"" correctly.The female main role is played by French actress Léa Seydoux and well. what can I say about her. I think she is a good actress and has stunning looks and I totally can see Bond falling for her. She looks breathtaking in this film, almost as good as in ""La belle et la bête"". The acting is above-par for Bond girls usually and she is doing a fine job with her character. Still, there are incongruences. She decides to leave Bond as she cannot live with another assassin, but quickly changes her mind, which destroys a strong farewell scene. And in the end, Bond chooses her and decides not to kill Blofeld and he says to Q that he is gone. Second time, Craig's Bond is deeply in love after Vesper Lynd and I wonder how they will elaborate on that story line. I hope she won't get killed early in the next Bond film, but I guess they somehow have to come up with a story to get her out of the picture for Bond to return to MI6. It will be quite a challenge to make this one credible and not too similar to Lynd's. If I hadn't known that Craig will return, this actually could have been a very nice ending to his turn as James Bond with Blofeld finally not being able to take Bond's most precious.I briefly mentioned Blofeld above and he is played by Christoph Waltz. I must say I like him as an actor, but by now, he feels very similar with his mannerisms in totally different characters he plays. His characters always have their very own brand of humour and it would actually be nice to see him as a completely serious character at some point. I found his Blofeld not as interesting as Mikkelsen's LeChiffre or Bardem's Silva, which is quite a pity as they tried so hard to make him more memorable with him being the head of Spectre of course and also with the whole brother story. Waltz' ""cuckoo"" was even a bit cringeworthy during their talk. The scene with Bond tied up in the chair and Blofeld acting like some psychopath scientist was really creepy, almost a touch of ""Marathon Man"". And of course of Connery's Goldfinger almost losing his balls to Auric's laser in this classic movie back then.Let's talk a bit about the henchmen: Wrestling legend Dave Bautista plays a character who does not really add something great to the story and does not even make sense. He comes into the room, kills apparently a high-profile aide of Blofeld and is still appreciated. I guess this was intended to show what a cold-blooded killer he is. But wasn't he intended to perform the stadium attack in Mexico City. This was completely forgotten for the rest of the film. Still, he was fun and his final fight with Bond (and Swann) was a nice addition to the long history of memorable train fight sequences in Bond films. Generally, he had nice presence. Calling him a modern Jaws would be too much honor, but he was fine overall and they did great in letting him be quiet. That emphasized his cold-blooded ruthless character.""Sherlock"" fans will appreciate the presence of Andrew Scott here. However, I must say that I did not find him too memorable. There is no denying he is a talented actor, but everything he did here he already did on ""Sherlock"" and not worse. Monica Bellucci was okay in her scene and shows us that Bond also has a weakness for older women. Ben Whishaw I remember not liking too much in previous films, but he was fine here as well. I am not yet too sure about the theme song this time, but it's probably not among my favorites.All in all, this was a good movie and I highly recommend going to a theater to see it on a big screen, not on a small computer screen. Then again , I am probably biased because of how big a fan of the franchise I am. I think it's worse than ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"", but better than ""Quantum of Solace"". One reason may be that the two I liked more have legendary locations, the ones in the title, and this one and ""Quantum of Solace"" do not. As a whole, this was not a great Bond film unfortunately, but a pretty good one with some nice inclusions and references to older films (Blofeld's scar). I certainly recommend the watch, but I still hope that the next Bond film (with or without Mendes) will be truly great again."
"Nice entry stars Daniel Craig as the tough, two-fisted James Bond who takes on nasty organization nicknamed Spectra with a octopus-like symbol . After a risked and disastrous assignment in Mexico, Bond is suspended. But he goes on his activities by tracking down a massive criminal syndicate. Then Bond receives a cryptic message from his dark past, it sends him pitted against a sinister and criminal group. It is led by a terrorist chief, Blofeld : Chistoph Waltz who has an ancient relationship with Bond's own childhood. While Q , Ben Wishaw, delivers him some rare and fantastic artifacts to carry out his dangerous missions. Shortly after, MI6 chief M : Ralph Fiennes is replaced by another boss, Andrew Scott. Later on, Bond meets the beautiful daughter, Lea Seydoux, of a long time enemy and then things go wrong.Once again Bond confronts an ominous and bloody organization with terrorist purports . This film takes parts of other 007 episodes as the violent fight between Bond and a hunk contender : Dave Bautista on a train , similar to Sean Connery versus Robert Shaw in From Russia with love. And the impresssive finale including the stronhold facility in the sunny desert and its destruction bears remarkable resemblance to Quantum of solace. Nicely played by Daniel Craig, this is his fourth entry, first was Casino Royale, following Quantum of solace and Skyfall. He is well accompanied by a young Bond girl, Lea Seydoux, and another Bond woman, the mature Monica Bellucci, the eldest Bond girl. The heinous leader of the powerful organization Spectra is magnetically performed by usual villain Christoph Waltz. Adding regulars of the old franchise as M well played by Ralph Fiennes, Q finely acted Ben Wishaw and Naomy Harris as Moneypenny.The film packs a colorful and glimmering cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, shot in various locations as Mexico city, Austria and especially in London. As well as pounding and rousing musical score by Thomas Newman. The motion picture was well directed by Sam Mendes, though with no originaly. Mendes is a good director who has made some successful films played by important actors, such as : Jarhead, American Beauty, Revolutionary road, Road to perdition and another Bond movie : Skyfall. Rating: Above average. Well worth watching."
"The opening sequence of Spectre will surely be a reason many people will want to get a copy of the movie after its theatrical run once it's on DVD and online, or even to just tune in if people know it'll be on TV. In one of those super-long (maybe too long?) tracking shots, Bond, in a skeleton mask during the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico City, goes into a building (with a girl by his side at first), then as it looks like there's about to be some lust he breaks off to get to his actual target: some sinister figures in a building next-door. Then it goes into one of those BIG action set pieces, mostly involving a helicopter that Bond has a BIG fight in, and has to do BIG maneuvers to make sure that he doesn't take out civilians. It's one of those sequences that the public goes to 007 movies for, and I'm sure Mendes knows this. One is almost tempted to say he, so to speak, blows his wad there, but this isn't to say Spectre, the 24th Bond film, is poor by any means. Just... flawed, to say the least.This is the movie that actually, without spoiling too much, ties together the Daniel Craig Bonds that we've had so far, with the villains and the love interest in Casino Royale, Vespar Lynd, in the mix. There's really two plots which eventually converge: 007 tracking down through Rome and Austria (and eventually Tangiers) what significance a ring with an octopus insignia has and who is connected to it - semi (not really) spoiler, it means everything - and then as the new M (Ralph Fiennes) has to contend with MI6 being folded into MI5, and a new surveillance program taking shape. Oh, and MI6 may not really be what it is any more, and a whole new government program to be the ""new"" spy organization takes shape.If this latter part sounds at all familiar, it should be if you've been to the movies just this year; I could've sworn I saw this very similar storyline for Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, which also dealt with the ""new"" taking over the ""old"" and the spies we know and love having to go rogue. That doesn't happen right away in Spectre, but it's certainly in the air. The other thing that will seem familiar is... well, a lot of things, mostly if you're a Bond fan by any stretch (casual watchers may miss things, not unlike people who went to, I dunno, Star Trek Into Darkness and only, maybe, knew about Khan). The real ""sectret"" part has to do with a Figure in the Shadows (that old, treasured cliché) who is played by Christoph Waltz. What does he have to do with 007? Do they know each other? All in good time, if you see the movies, you'll find out.But, again, it won't be any big surprise if you've seen other movies, like Thunderball as the primary example. Once again Mendes has visual flair and capable, stylish filmmaking (and a new DP in Hoyte who is really remarkable, barely a shade less than Deakins for Skyfall), and Craig is game to play this character the best he can. But for all of the build up of the first two acts, it felt like the third let itself down, or let me down or both. It's not that it doesn't build to something elaborate - on the contrary, it's something SO elaborate it's over-elaborate, in both how this entire Spectre organization functions and the actions that Waltz's character takes from one scene to the next as he finally takes charge as a villain. The trouble is too, as much build up as he gets and as much as Waltz soaks up playing this guy, there's not enough of him. Or, maybe there is enough, but what he does is things that we've seen Bond villains do before - or, to the point that we've seen certain elements that have been *parodied* in other films. All that's missing are fish with laser beams attached to their heads.This isn't all to say the movie is bad in any way. Spectre will deliver for fans of the franchise and just those people wanting some escape with the Martini-gun-toting-super-sex-being that is this hero. The filmmakers clearly love this world, in making characters like M and Q matter more than they might've in the past which is all well and good (Fiennes and Whishaw do well when they can), Monica Bellucci shows up and is great to see as the oldest (but, sadly, briefest) of Bond women, and the ending feels almost like the entire end to the franchise itself (not that it would be, it'd be like saying that there are no other organizations to monitor surveillance in the world oh nevermind). I may even watch it again on TV some time, but as it is plot gaps and/or set-piece over-compensation got the better of this movie."
"I watched this film right after ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and was surprised to see the character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) show up again, but this time it's the son of the character in 'Diamonds'. Which is somewhat confusing when you consider that the 'Spectre' Blofeld referenced his father in the past mentoring the childhood James Bond, thereby setting up a personal rivalry between them. So who was the James Bond in the 'Diamonds' film? I'm not a Bond fan well enough at this point (while watching the films out of order) to understand if there's a lineage in the Bond family, but it doesn't seem likely to me. Oh well.Aside from the revelation of a criminal organization known as SPECTRE, this is pretty much a by-the-numbers Bond flick with all the elements we're used to seeing in prior films. However Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci) isn't around long enough to classify as a true Bond villainess, while Dr. Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) doesn't appear to have the charisma needed to pull off her role as Bond's assistant. Andrew Scott lacked the gravitas needed to pull off the role of Max Denbigh/'C' of the newly merged British Intelligence unit comprised of MI5 and MI6, leaving Blofeld perhaps the most interesting character. Daniel Craig himself appeared a bit lackluster to me as well, it might have helped if he cracked a smile every now and then.I did like the opening Mexico City segment, very colorful and culminating with the best action sequence of the picture. Trouble is, it just about topped everything else that followed making even the reveal of SPECTRE's global surveillance system somewhat anti-climactic. But now that I've gotten on this recent James Bond kick, I'm inclined to view the entire series in order of release to get a sense of continuity going and get up to speed with events and characters I'm not familiar with. Should be an interesting exercise."
"This is James Bond straight, for a change. The original series, begun in the early 1960s, was a big and inexpensive hit. A lot of trend setters were reading Ian Fleming -- President Kennedy was a fan -- and Fleming's stories made mincemeat out of the Cold War. SMERSH? And the young Sean Connery was the perfect screen incarnation of Bond, a parody of handsome masculinity -- and a knowing one -- with that cartoonishly broad mouth, that tongue-in-cheek smirk, and the throw-away wisecracks the script gave him.The series may have been the initial stimulus for the rash of increasingly silly action films that followed. The series itself seemed swallowed up by them in the 1980s but soldiered on anyway, though I can't imagine who was anxious to see them.This one takes Bond seriously. The jokes are few. Although the formula is overly familiar, it's clear that a lot of money was spent on this attempt to breathe new life into a dead horse. (These mixed clichés do full justice to the film.) In the opening scene, Bond chases a villain through an industrial construction site in Madagascar. The pair climb innumerable staircases of latticed steel before coming mano a mano at the end of a sky-high giant crane, after which they leap from the top of one building to the top of the next one lower down, until they reach the ground and somebody pulls a gun and -- well, the blanks can be filled in at leisure. Since there is no more USSR, the heavies are now some camarilla of terrorists, not that it matters. Spectacular stunt work, by the way. In the final action sequence, James Bond sinks a building on the Grand Canal in Venice with a few well-placed pistol shots. (The building floats on pontoons.) The action is interrupted by some short scenes of intrigue, a card game with a pot of $130 million that today, given the dollar's trajectory, is worth about half that much. Bond's chief opponent in the game is Le Chiffre (Mad Mikkelsen) who has a face and expression resembling that of a freshly stuffed and painted corpse. Daniel Craig is Bond himself. He's at least not ludicrously handsome though heavily muscled. Whether he can act or not can't be determined because evidently he was told not to try. Eva Greene, on the other hand, is magnificently glamorized. She could steal my $130 million any day, though I wouldn't let her near my Swedish Kroner. A dirty shame she has to drown at the end, despite her perfidy, inasmuch as we haven't yet had a chance to see her nude. We'll have to rely on our memories of Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"" for that.Should you see it? Sure, why not? There hasn't been an expensive, colorful, exotic action movie in at least a year. There was an earlier version of ""Casino Royale"", in 1967, I think. It was a headlong, feckless, comic spoof. I enjoyed it more than this version."
"The James Bond 007 series has been a worldwide success, with five stars already bringing the famous spy to life, but this was a gamble, to reboot the series, seeing how it all started for the leading hero, and it worked, based on the first Ian Fleming novel from writer Paul Haggis (Crash) and director Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, The Mask of Zorro). The film opens with James Bond (BAFTA nominated Daniel Craig) earning his licence to kill and being promoted to double-0 status, designated 007, to do this two kills are needed. Bond then travels to Madagascar and is in a parkour (free running) bomb-maker Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan), against orders Bond kills him, but searching through his mobile phone he traces Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian), an associate of banker and terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). As Bond follows the clues, he wins a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 car in a game of poker against Dimitrios, seduces his wife Solange (Caterina Murino) and foils Le Chiffe's plan to destroy the prototype Skyfleet airliner at Miami International Airport, also killing henchman Carlos (Claudio Santamaria). M (Dame Judi Dench), head of MI6, informs Bond that Le Chiffe has set up a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro, as the best card player in the agency Bond is being put in the game, Le Chiffe is a great card player also, if he wins terrorism will have been funded. Bond is joined by beautiful British Treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), who is protecting government interests, and assisting him posing as his lover to distract the other poker players, and local MI6 contact René Mathis (Hannibal's Giancarlo Giannini) has put pressure on Le Chiffe by having two of his associates arrested. In the tournament Bond tries to read Le Chiffe and catch him bluffing, he loses his initial stake on a misplayed hand, Vesper refuses to give him $5,000,000 to continue playing, Bond frustrated plans to assassinate Le Chiffe, but fellow player and undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) stops him, he gives Bond the stake in exchange for custody of Le Chiffe. Back in the game Bond re-establishes himself, but Le Chiffe attempts to kill him, his girlfriend Valenka (Ivana Milicevic) poisons Bond's drink, he goes into cardiac arrest, but Vesper helps save him at the point of death. In the final phase of the game are four players, Fukutu (Tom So), Infante (Ade), Le Chiffe and Bond, all players go all in, but Bond wins the tournament with a high hand straight flush, all winnings are deposited in a Swiss bank account. Le Chiffe's henchmen capture Vesper and use her as bait to catch Bond, Le Chiffe tortures Bond with him strapped naked to a bottomless chair and smacking his (unseen) testicles with a long rope, but Bond does not give in, Le Chiffe is interrupted and killed for being untrustworthy by his liaison Mr. White (Jesper Christensen). Bond recovers in hospital on Lake Como, Mathis, who was in fact working for Le Chiffe, is arrested, and Bond admits to Vesper that he is in love with her, and posts his resignation to M. Travelling to Venice however, Bond finds out the winnings were never deposited into the Treasury's account, Vesper has stolen it, he pursues her into a building under renovation, a firefight ensues with Bond and the men she was giving the money to, with the inflatable supports holding the building above water punctured. The men are killed and Bond tries to rescue Vesper trapped in an iron-frame lift underwater, but she locks the gate and allows herself to drown, Bond is unable to revive her once on the surface, Mr. White watching nearby walks away with the money. In the end Bond rejoins MI6, he finds out Vesper had a French-Algerian boyfriend, Yusef Kabira, being held by the organisation behind Le Chiffe and Mr. White, they blackmailed her to cooperate, and she was delivering the money to save James's life, the final scene sees Bond tracing Mr. White, capturing him, and introducing himself with his iconic catchphrase, ""The name's Bond. James Bond"". Also starring Tobias Menzies as Villiers, Sébastien Foucan as Mollaka, Isaach De Bankolé as Steven Obanno, Tsai Chin as Madame Wu, Veruschka von Lehndorff as Gräfin von Wallenstein, Malcolm Sinclair as Dryden, Richard Branson Man at Airport Security and Gunther von Hagens. Craig was a controversial choice, a blonde Bond, but he proved the doubters wrong with a fantastic performance, giving us a Bond with depth, Green is great as his alluring love interest, and Mikkelsen is splendidly sinister as the villain with haemolacria - a damaged eye vessel which causes him to weep blood. The opening black and white sequence seeing Bond become a double-0 is brutal and cool, the film drops Moneypenny, Q and gadgetry and camp humour for a serious and well-written story, filled with fantastic action, stunts, gun and fist fights and chases, the film achieved a Guinness World Record for the crashing Aston Martin DBS rotating seven times, the song ""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell is catchy as well, overall a brilliant spy adventure. It won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for David Arnold, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"
"Since my actual birthday was near, my friend offered to pay for both my admission and concessions when seeing this movie. We both enjoyed Casino Royale, my friend saying it was one of the best. I heartily agree since it was based on the first James Bond novel and as such it stays true to Ian Fleming's version of 007. Daniel Craig makes a great impression as a Bond who gets hurt both physically and mentally (the torture scene with Le Chiffre is especially painful to watch though there's still some humor to make it palatable). I love both Judi Danch's M (""God, I miss the Cold War"") and Eva Green's Vesper Lynd (she goes from frosty to witty to playful convincingly in the space of an hour). And there are the great action set-pieces we've come to love in Bond movies involving construction sites and airports. In my opinion, Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. So, yes, I highly recommend Casino Royale."
"For many years, I have longed to see a James Bond series actually based on the books. While some of the Bond films have been a lot of fun, most have practically nothing to do with the great Ian Fleming novels. Sadly, in a few cases (such as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE), about the only similarity between the books and the movies were the titles! In fact, the original CASINO ROYALE was a horrid film in practically every way except for the music. While some of the characters were retained, the movie was an abysmal mess--a very high budget and confusing mess. It was purported to be a comedy, though practically none of the film was funny and like YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the plot was impossible to follow and bore no similarity to the book. Fans of Ian Fleming usually twitch with disgust at even hearing the title of this god-awful film--thank goodness someone FINALLY wanted to do the Fleming novel some justice!In the books, Bond was a bourbon drinking, chain-smoking assassin. CASINO ROYALE was the first book and Bond was his most human in it. In the book, Bond struggled with guilt over the many people he'd killed--and they were NOT killed in crazy and exotic ways like they were in most of the movies. Most were either shot or killed with his bare hands. Bond was, above all else, a killer--not quite as sexy or sophisticated as he was in the films. While Craig isn't quite the same as Fleming's Bond (he's missing the scar down his cheek), he's much closer to the novels than any prior Bond incarnation. I miss that Bond and am glad that, in part, the new CASINO ROYALE finally features much of this cold-blooded and flawed character.Now I do understand that EON Productions couldn't repeat the novel completely--heck, it was set in the early 1950s and many allowances needed to be made for current events. And as far as the updates went, they generally were in the same spirit as the original movie and the cat and mouse game between Le Chiffre and Bond is essentially that of the novel.All this does NOT mean that the movie will only appeal to those who read the books. There are still many exciting chase scenes and stunts like you'd expect to see in a Bond film but fortunately Bond didn't seem so invincible. Daniel Craig's version of Bond could apparently do what the prior Bonds could do, but you'll notice throughout the film that he's cut and bruised--not exactly a man of steel. I loved this and it did tend to make the unrealness of the stunts seem a tad more believable. Plus, again, Fleming would be thrilled as several stories he wrote talked about the toll on Bond's body.The film was well-constructed, stunt heavy but not enough to alienate purists like myself and intelligently written. About the only people who will strongly dislike this film are those who are looking for a reincarnation of Sean Connery or Roger Moore. Craig certainly doesn't look or act like either of these two guys. While I could easily imagine Connery's or Moore's characters sipping martinis while engaged in gay banter with their arch-enemies, Craig is more the type you'd expect to beat the enemies to death with his bare hands--like a REAL government assassin. Wow, do I like the change!PS--The Aston Martin DBS V12 in this movie is a gorgeous car and it should be with a base price of $265,000. In the film, it is destroyed and I truly hope this was a model or something other than one of these great sports cars--it would be tragic if they really did in this car!"

"'Halloween Kills' is the definition of a sequel for the sake of making a sequel (or more accurately the sake of making money). It not only adds nothing to the story, it destroys some of the good things from the 2018 version. I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time with the COVID delays, and I sadly have to say it was not worth the wait at all.The characters in this movie were atrocious. Firstly, they destroyed 'Laurie Strode'. Not only does she do absolutely nothing in this movie, she is rude to kind nurses and assaults a doctor. Yup, that'll get us on her side. But that wasn't even the worst of it. The side characters they created for this film were embarrassing. There is a scene where a character just stares at 'Michael Myers', says something to the effect of, ""Michael, you've come home"", and then just stands there and waits to be killed. That's the worst example of it, but this is very much a rinse and repeat thing throughout the film.The pacing of the film is all over the place too. There's a very strange and uninteresting opening scene. Then we get a couple of admittedly great scenes with the firefighters and in a house with a couple. At this point I was having a good time. 'Michael' was ferocious and in no mood to mess around. Then we hit a wall and frankly never recovered. Even at the end when the film should be building up to the big conclusion, it feels like it's stuck in first gear.Also there's a subplot involving a mental patient that is just unpleasant. It's not scary, it's not clever, it's just depressing and unnecessary (and quite insulting to the audience that we are expected to buy it). I didn't find much to enjoy about this film sadly. It looks great and the start was decent. Otherwise though it's not one I can recommend. 4/10."
"David Gordon Green is one of the few people I trust in the Hollywood community and has a prominent place in my DVD/Blu-Ray archive. But this movie did not happen. They've abused a myth so much that it's empty. It is no longer exciting.Even if the stars I've always loved, from Thomas Mann to Will Patfon, are in the cast.Hollywood must stop exploiting cult productions to the bone."
"Not easy to follow, jumps back and forth to the other halloween nights where mr myers have tortured this city. There has now been made far to many sequels to this mm caracter, maybe its time to give him the final push into the purgatory???But urban legends will survive nevertheless, and for the halloween industry ,flicks like this makes money in the cash register and sows fright and agony in every new trick or treat generation, i'm happy that the tradition is very sparse over here rural norway(its an urban phenomenon mostly)...theres nothing new here, some more gore and advanced special effects, but the idea is the same. So for me the grumpy old man the music will alwaysgive an adrenaline kick, the rest is just an average repeat of the past, just a could see film, cause there are better films on the present market."
"First of all, I must admit that I have never really been much of a friend of the ""Halloween"" franchise, though I have seen all the movies. Might seem odd, right? Well, you're right. Sure, I've seen all the movies as I do enjoy horror movies and slasher movies, but I've just never warmed as much up to ""Halloween"" as I did for franchises like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"".So when this 2021 addition to the ""Halloween"" franchise was announced, I wasn't just exactly thrilled. But as I had the opportunity to watch it, of course I did sit down to do so.And sure, ""Halloween Kills"" is a watchable movie, and it certainly is among the better of the ""Halloween"" franchise since the original movie. But I have to say, though, that this wasn't a milestone in horror cinema by any account.The storyline told in ""Halloween Kills"" is adequate, although I found a bit unnecessary. But it made for adequate entertainment, given the sheer brutality of the murders committed by Michael Myers. And yeah, there were some pretty cool-looking kills in the movie, I will say that much. And those alone actually make the movie well worth watching.Sure, I was thrilled to have Jamie Lee Curtis return to the movie - yet again - but she didn't really play that much of a big role throughout the movie, so it was somewhat disappointing. But of course it was nice to see her in the movie, and she did add a good element to the movie. Judy Greer actually put on a good performance in the movie.Visually then ""Halloween Kills"" is top notch. It is a dark and gritty movie, and they definitely upped the game in terms of visceral kills that puts you right in the slaughtering gore.""Halloween Kills"" is a watchable and entertaining enough movie if you enjoy slasher movies, and it will definitely bring enjoyment to the fans of the franchise, of that I am quite sure.My rating of ""Halloween Kills"" lands on a six out of ten stars."
"Completely clueless about what it wants to be or where its priorities lie, Halloween Kills is an absolute trainwreck of a sequel from start to finish. A dull, pointless & thoroughly frustrating entry that fails to capitalise on the blank canvas after the 2018 film wiped the slate clean by retconning the franchise, this latest instalment is an utter mess that's all over the place and unsure of its own identity.Co-written & directed by David Gordon Green, the story shift the focus on other survivors of Michael Myers' 1978 killing spree by sidelining our protagonist yet does it so awfully that we are never for once invested in the new characters. Green does the bare minimum to improve the ride, has no idea what tone to settle with, and branches the story out in directions that's neither warranted nor called for.It attempts to give us a peek of the trauma that Myers inflicted on not just Laurie Strode but the entire Haddonfield community and skims on mob mentality in dumb, facepalm-inducing ways. The film is devoid of tension, build-up & atmosphere, Myers' looming presence is also gone, and the narrative flow & editing is a nightmare. The only aspects working in its favour are the grisly kills & Carpenter's score.Overall, Halloween Kills features a healthy dose of gnarly kills & slasher brutality but the rest is not only underwhelming, it's almost cringeworthy. The callbacks are mere distractions, the subplots lead nowhere, performances are forgettable, and it really made me root for Michael Myers as he creatively slaughters a lot of stupid, annoying folks in this. A wasted potential at best, this newest chapter adds nothing to the saga."
The story is engaging and original. I couldn't have guessed the ending!
"From the director of Saw, Insidious & The Conjuring comes a stylishly crafted, consistently thrilling & gleefully violent nightmare that's stained with blood, soaked in terror & smeared with body counts. Gripping from the get-go, keeping its viewers guessing for the most part and going absolutely bonkers in the end, Malignant feels fresh despite treading familiar grounds and is one of the goriest entries in mainstream horror.Directed by James Wan, his latest feature marks his return to his horror roots and serves as his love letter to giallo films, with elements of slasher, splatter & camp also coursing through its veins. The film sets the tone with its vicious opening prologue, after which Wan paves the groundwork quickly for the main plot to kick into action and directs with glee, passion & confidence while exploiting the R-rated freedom to its max.The characters aren't fleshed enough for the viewers to give a damn about any of them but Wan narrates the story with such grip, energy & vibrance that the interest is never lost. And the last 30 mins are crazy as Wan removes the shackles and allows the film to go full camp. Also notable is the aesthetic brilliance, for the flamboyant camerawork, breezy pace, smart editing & jarring score infuse their own flavours and enrich every set piece.Overall, Malignant presents James Wan in control of his craft as he tackles a slice of horror he hadn't explored before, and delivers a fun & fiendish supernatural slasher that's riveting, unpredictable & delightfully deranged. Embracing not only the strengths of gialli but also its shortcomings, Malignant isn't going to satisfy every palate but the cinematic craftsmanship on display & Wan's head-on approach makes it worthy of appreciation & admiration. Go for it."
"Before I watched the movie, I knew there would be a lot of twists in the movie, but there were no spoilers. So I watched the movie to see a twist. Frankly, I think James Wan did a good job. Annebelle Wallis was great, the other actors were bad, but not that bad. Music was very good. I also like tweets. The movie received mixed ratings. I liked the movie overall. The effects weren't bad either. It's not James Wan's best job, but I don't think it's his bad job. It's definitely not a horror movie, but it's a good thriller. My rating is 7/10."
"There aren't too many original ways you can do a horror story left, but this one really pulled out the stops with the introduction of that teratoma on Maddie Mitchell's (Annabelle Wallis) back. I'd never heard of anything like that, and the way it was used here leant new meaning to the word creepy. That was certainly enough to pique anyone's interest level just for the sheer audacity of it. I thought the story had some good hooks and twists, although the manner in which Gabriel was able to take out all those cops was way over the top. As weird as the whole premise was for the story line, I thought it all worked pretty well with a surprising amount of continuity in explaining how Madison got to be who she was. I didn't really see how the ending was meant to offer a definitive conclusion, so maybe there's a Malignant Two lurking in the works. Wouldn't that be a kick in the head?"
"James Wan's ""Malignant"" isn't a horror masterpiece, but it has a clever plot. I didn't see any of it coming, and there are some intense - if improbable - scenes. Worth seeing.McKenna Grace is going to play the younger version of everyone, it seems."
"It all fizzled out with the denouement!I thought I had found a really good horror mystery film until the last ten minutes when it all went to hell in a handbasket...literally...Such a shame as it had superb atmosphere, acting was top notch and a real sense of dread pervaded every scene and for once a horror film that was quite scary but then it all went plop right down the Thomas Ritter!Shame as it might have gotten a 7 or above rating!!!"
"I saw ""The Night House"", starring Rebecca Hall-Godzilla vs. Kong, Iron Man 3; Sarah Goldberg-Barry_tv, The Dark Knight Rises; Evan Jonigkeit-Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, X_Men:Days of Future Past and Vondie Curtis_Hall-Daredevil_tv, Broken Arrow.This is a good and a bad one. It's good because of the actors-Rebecca, in particular-but bad because of the story. It's just a tad on the confusing side. Rebecca & Evan are a married couple that, from all appearances, seem to be a happy couple of 14 years that live in a secluded lake front property that Evan built. One night, Evan takes their row boat out on the lake and commits suicide. As Rebecca tries to find out what went wrong, she discovers that Evan had secrets. Rebecca also starts hearing noises and seeing a mysterious shadowy figure-Evan, maybe?-haunting their house. Sometimes, she will see a figure and then wake up-was it all a dream? She also discovers blue prints to a reverse house-their house, but everything is backwards-and even finds the house across the lake and it contains a strange looking voodoo doll. It doesn't help when she confides in her best friend Sarah, who thinks she is just distraught over everything or her neighbor Vondie, who might know more than he is letting on to. Then, there are some pictures of other women that Rebecca finds on Evan's phone-I guess he didn't realize that women will look at men's phones-and they all the girls look suspiciously like her. Like I said, it just gets a little confusing.It's rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing images, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you really want to see it, I guess it would be alright, as a rental."
"Beth (Rebecca Hall) is a high school teacher whose husband Owen (Evan Jonigkeit) recently shot himself. She has nightmares and there are signs of a haunting. She confides in friends who tell her to let things alone. Owen was a designer and builder. He was into Caedroia, the Celtic belief of making mazes to confuse evil demons. Beth discovers pictures of women on Owen's phone, all who look like Beth.This is a mystery with limit clues that is explained in the end. I liked the idea, but they best part of the film is all the action Owen did. I think it might have worked better if the film took place with his suicide at the end.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."

"David Bruckner, who showed his style with The Ritual, once again made an appearance with a good movie.The atmosphere we miss, the kind of scenario we miss.The musical scores accompanying the film wonderfully and Rebecca Hall, who can always do justice to these roles.Definitely needs to be watched on a good sound system.Again, I love Sundance Film Festival."
"The Marvel train keeps on rolling and getting more and more confident. There was a time that they wouldn't have released Venom. An obscure character except to the Spider-Man and Marvel fans, not truly a good guy, relies heavily on CGI to make him like the comic--not likely a movie they would've released in years past. But now Marvel has built such a good brand, much like Apple, Google, Nike, etc., they can boldly release nearly any character with a certain amount of confidence.Venom had a bit of a weak storyline to it but it was good once they got into the meat and potatoes. It was a bit contrived in order to get Venom merged with Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) but they did a good job making the audience forget how we'd gotten to the action. Venom has staying power like most Marvel movies."
"Eddie Brock ( Tom Hardy) is a down on his luck and dumped reporter that becomes the host of a faceless, armless, legless extraterrestrial with a bottomless pit of an appetite with extraordinary superpowers. But will all the lethal powers manage to stand protector against other weaponized evil rivals. VENOM is a fantastic mess that will capture you and leave you black and blue."
"Didn't know the backstory of Venom but you don't need that because it's all explained very quickly and that is what makes this a enjoyable really good movie. I was in it from the beginning, no bad moments at all and suddenly it was all over. Great ending too. Makes you eager to watch Venom 2.Tom Hardy does great as Venom. If you can't stand jokes in a superhero flick stay away from this. The spiderman flicks did had funny situations and the Deadpool franchise was over the top of jokes, this is in between. Because the 'parasite' do talk to Tom it makes it all great. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of fighting going on and that is really nasty, no jokes there.Better than expected, Venom is really worth seeing.

"This is a fantastic Marvel film! I really like the visuals. The car chase scene is jaw droppingly intense. The way Venom can be good and bad is a really fresh thing to see in a Marvel film. There is comedy and jokes too, and somehow Venom reminds me of Deadpool because of the big white eyes!"

"I began watching Bond films with ""Dr. No."" I have been thrilled, disappointed, exhilarated, bored, and challenged. The best Bond movies are the ones that have a cohesion, despite the action sequences. There were times when I wondered if the producers packaged these by the pound. How many ridiculous chase scenes can you cram into a space. That's OK sometimes because these films have a sense of humor and an in-your-face craziness that is a hallmark. However, it's the space that may be a problem. The later films are just too long. When a confrontation takes twenty minutes to resolve, you need a program to try to remember the big picture. This one suffers from the same affliction. While things do eventually resolve themselves, we are led all over the place where distraction is the result. I must say that I stayed pretty interest throughout, but at times I began to look at my watch, wanting to cut to the chase. I like Daniel Craig. He seems to be a more complex Bond than some of the others, but the screenplays need editing and the action sequences more under control."
"Until a couple months ago, ""Skyfall"" was the newest entry to the famous 007 franchise. Then ""Spectre"" came, also begins with an ""S"", also 7 letters. Obviously, Academy-Award winning director (""American Beauty"") Sam Mendes and the people in charge of this film tried all they could to replicate the success of ""Skyfall"", yet they came somewhat short. I am not saying ""Spectre"" is a bad film, not at all, it is a good film like ""Quantum of Solace"", but both are clearly inferior to ""Skyfall"". I always think that one crucial indicator about how good a Bond film is is the memorability of the places. And there are many great places in here. The finale at Skyfall is pretty badass, but the real ending at the small church is just as good and even more significant. Then there is the place with the Komodo dragons, the replacement location for MI:6, the locations where Bond fights Patrice (on top of the train and in front of the luminous jellyfish) or even in the very cold water, almost at the end, a nice reference back to the intro sequence very early. All of these are great shots and one reason why this film is seen the way it is.Then there is the characters. The introduction of Moneypenny, the introduction of Fiennes' character and what he turns out in the end, the scenes with Dench's character (oldest Bond girl in history and one of the most memorable) etc. The character development is something that was totally missing in the newest Bond film in my opinion, even when it comes to Bond himself, who has to find his strength again. And then there is Silva, of course. Javier Bardem does not appear until halfway into the film. His actions are there for the entire first half, but we do not see him until 70 minutes in. And the only bad thing really is that he did not appear earlier. He lifts this film again to an entirely new level in my opinion. Bond villains are always a bit gimmicky and he is at least as much fun to watch as Le Chiffre in the equally great ""Casino Royale"". The trick is to make them gimmicky, but still make them seem realistic and that is something that worked really nicely here. I wish I could say the same about Waltz in the newest film. Oh well, back to Silva: He has so many memorable scenes and actions in here I cannot name them all. The trademark blonde hair with the Hispanic background, the homosexuality, the fake teeth and I could go on and on. He really deserved the Oscar nomination. Really sucks to see he did not get it. He was probably very close. I also quite liked the way the character was introduced when we finally got to see him. The static camera and Silva approaching us and Bond, this was very tense and very smart. One of the finest shots from the film. Oh yeah and as you may have expected around the 90-minute mark, MI:6 really has a problem with keeping their prisoners. So many manage to flee in these films. They need to work on that.Some other people working on this film, however, were more successful than Bardem and I quite like that. They won a tied vote with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in Sound Editing (well-deserved as ""Skyfall"" is also great from a technical perspective) and Adele won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her excellent theme song. This was already the second time I watched ""Skyfall"". First time I saw it in theaters right when it came out back in 2012. This is certainly a film that makes an even bigger impact when you see it on a really big screen, but it's just such a wonderful example of quality filmmaking that it is also worth seeing on a small one. Now, critics will say as usual that this is not the old Bond in the traditional style and sense of the films and they may be right. But I personally love the new approach to Bond just as much. There are also many clever references back to the old days, for example the one about exploding pens etc. So this film also brings a lot of humour, mostly via smart and witty funny comments, such as Dench's character saying she will not turn her back on the woman who questions her or Bond's comment near the end that he had to take a short swim. A truly delightful movie. It runs for almost 2.5 hours (considerably longer than the previous entry) and does not drag at all. It's tense, it's entertaining, it's well-written and well-acted. Everything you could ask for in a film and I highly recommend the watch."
"You know, I have to laugh. In the opening action sequence, James Bond (Daniel Craig) runs a motorcycle into a waist high abutment in order to catapult the bike away, and him onto the top of a moving train in order to get at the bad guy. He's shot by his partner, falls over a hundred feet into a river, and then goes over a waterfall. Given up for dead, you know as the viewer he's going to pop up again somehow, and when he does, he's shown panting for breath after doing some laps in a swimming pool! How does that make any kind of sense? I guess we aren't supposed to think about it.But the thing is, if you put all the James Bond films into a list here on IMDb, then rank them in order of viewer ratings, it's ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" that occupy the top two positions. I think that's more a reflection of the audience's need and desire for large scale action set pieces and impossible stunts than for the actor portraying Bond, although you do have to give Daniel Craig credit where credit's due. He's taken the character to a much darker place without an array of goofy gadgets, even if I question the manner in which he was able to smoke out 'Granborough Road' out of an impossible series of encrypted graphics. To my mind, it would help if Craig would crack a smile every now and then to show that he's human; I can't imagine anyone being so serious for any length of time without the need for some kind of emotional release.However Bond does go in the opposite direction even more when at the finale, M (Judi Dench) dies, and Bond cries! That's something I thought I'd never see, and perhaps confirmation that Double 0-7 does have a reservoir of emotion somewhere inside. With the franchise getting ready to release another picture in 2020, It will be interesting to see how Daniel Craig performs in ""Bond 25"", almost a full decade after his character couldn't pass the MI6 physical or qualify on the shooting range."
"Bond's loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. Whilst MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.At first, it took some getting used to, because Daniel Craig (despite being English) looks more Russian than anything else. He could be Vladimir Putin's brother, and would make a great Bond villain. But once I adjusted, he was actually quite good at the role, even if not as suave as Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery.And having Javier Bardem as a villain was a stroke of genius. He plays bad guy roles well, and it is great to see him getting more and more exposure for international audiences. Truly a treasure of the screen."
"Not too hard to realize that for half a century, we have shared ups and downs, and survived crisis after crisis with Agent 007. This is the 23 James Bond installment and third starring Daniel Craig, as that beloved cool and captivating super spy. Say too much, say too little; SKYFALL has a different feel for some reason. Everyone can find their own reason for dissing and hissing at this one. Bond is vulnerable and yet dynamic and again the man you can depend on. M16 comes under attack and so does the credibility of M(Judi Dench), as she must relocate the agency. Her past creeps in to haunt her and this new dilemma has her putting her only hope in 007 to uncover its origins. Bond will have the aid of agency field agent Eve(Naomi Harris)to challenge a new Chairman of Intelligence(Ralph Fiennes)and follow a treacherous trail of a mysterious madman(Javier Bardem). Explosion after explosion is typical, but having M playing a more active role is not. Somehow of course, the old saying proves true...there IS a reason for everything. I really found the use of ""Boom Boom"" by The Animals fitting. And you can't ignore the wonderful theme by Adele, that I feel will be memorable for a long time. Also in the cast: Rory Kinnear, Bill Buckhurst, Ben Whishaw, Berenice Marlohe and Ian Bonar."
"The story is interesting, but there's not enough suspense. There's something missing."
"I was really disappointed with this. It's an intriguing story from M. Night Shyamalan that is really let down by some lacklustre casting and a really lousy script. A few holidaymakers are taken to a beach where they discover that not only are they trapped there, but that they begin to age rapidly too... Can they escape? Sadly, I didn't really care - the characters are pretty unremarkable, and although the setting is beautiful the rest of it is slow and dull to watch. Rufus Sewell stands out as probably the worst of the bunch, but only marginally more so than an equally out of place Gael García Bernal who really did look like he was just waiting for his cheque to arrive. The last twenty minutes could have retrieved the situation had they be handled better, but what little jeopardy - or plausibility the story had had until then just evaporated. Shyamalan ought to have enough clout nowadays to ensure his quirky and intelligent stories are better presented in terms of talent and, especially given it's his own screenplay - writing too."
". . . does a fine bang-up job of documenting the fact that these Public Enemies are only in it for the money. Big Pill's callous disregard for the well-being of actual patients is prominently displayed throughout OLD. Rather than injecting THEIR OWN parents, siblings and children with experimental but potentially lucrative ""cures,"" the OLD quacks virtually kidnap unsuspecting and ill-informed ""test subjects"" off the streets and murder them during diabolical torture trials. Abused without their consent, 73 batches of OLD victims (about 876 men, women, kids and babies, along with their 109 pets) are not even given Christian burials. OLD argues that it's high time to stop these mercenary medical profiteers dead in their tracks BEFORE they can come for YOU and yours. After seeing this film, most viewers should be in the mood to storm over to their corner Big Pharmaceutical neighborhood outlet, and raze its roof. How could anyone walk out of OLD, and not take immediate remedial action?"
"Such a brilliant unique thought provoking gem of the year! I wish I could thank M. Night Shyamalan for such an amazing piece of cinema. I think Old is very refreshing and deserves higher ratings. The cast did great, writing is smooth, cinematography is magnificent and the terror is top notch. I hope the movie gets lots of praise cause it's truly a special experience! I also hope people appreciate my review, I didn't want to spoil anything just know that it'll be worth it!"
"4 out of 5 stars.Old is a good thriller film and one of M. Night Shyamalans better films. Which his films are hit and miss with its direction. Old is a hit film. Has a mystery plot. Thrills and themes with a message of time being against us.The plot follows a group of people on a vacation. Going to a resort where they all visit a hidden beach. Which gives them the luxury and beautiful beach. Only until they discover that they are aging at a rapid pace. The kids are growing rapidily. The adults aging. While they have trouble escaping the beach which they black out and end up back at the beach. They cant swim or climb the rocks surrounding the beach without blacking out. The group try to solve the mystery on what the connection is that they have in common. And how are they aging.Good thriller. The cinematography is great. Capturing the beautiful landscape and shocking tone the characters have. The music score is good. The cast ensemble is great. The twist ending is not that bad. Which did not disappoint like M. Nights other films.It does have an interesting concept without going into spoiler territory. And leaving a bit of mystery with the characters connection and the beach. The theme of people not having enough time to spend it with there loved ones was also good.I will say the only negative thing about the movie is it does have a shallow ending that does not feel satisfying.Overall, a good thriller thats worth seeing."
"The advent of video and then discs has made films from around the world more available than ever. Where once you had to live near a theater that specialized in foreign films now you can buy or rent them with ease. Where once Oscar nominated foreign films were seen by few now everyone has that chance. And now a film chosen by Denmark for this year's (2019) Oscars that didn't make the finalists is available. After watching THE GUILTY I think they made a mistake.Danish police officer Asger Holm (Jakob Cedergren) is on restricted duty in answering their version of 9-1-1 calls. Unlike most he's not one to take many of these calls seriously. As examples he chastises a drug user calling because he's overdosed rather than direct him on how to stay alive while another is a john whose been mugged by a prostitute. Asger suggest he not visit prostitutes.As the movie progresses we get bits and pieces of something else going on in Asger's life. Nothing is clearly defined but the reason for his new duties revolve around an inquisition to take place the next day. The details of what happened are not revealed but as things progress we begin to get clues.As his shift is about to end Asger gets a call that changes everything. The call is from a woman who's been kidnapped by her ex-husband. Somehow she's been able to call in but her husband is unaware. The woman's name is Iben and she relates what it happening to her while Asger tries to calm her down and find out where she is. As their conversation progresses he learns that her young daughter and baby are home alone and he sends police there to investigate.The calls between Iben and Asger are broken up with calls back as he tries to help her. As he tries to calm her and get more clues as to her location he begins to learn more about her and what is taking place. Talking to her daughter he gets more information. But when he talks to the police who arrived at the scene to care for the girl he learns the most horrific thing of all.Before all is said and done things will turn on their head and the reality that Asger assumed to be true may not be so after all. His preconceived notions of what was transpiring on the other end of the phone with each phone call is shaken to their core and he learns something about himself in the process.The movie is only 85 minutes long and all of it takes place in the offices where Asger and the others answering phone calls work. If they wanted they could even make this a stage play. But in spite of this the film ends up being one of the most intense films released in recent years. It's composed of conversations with no action to be seen and yet the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish.I never once found myself in search of the remote while watching this, trying to get through the boring scenes in hopes that better ones would follow. The pacing, the acting, the directing all combine here to make an effective thriller that will stick with you after the final credits role. Not only is this a great example of a foreign film but it's one that I know I will watch more than once. I would suggest that if the chance presents itself you make the attempt to do so as well."
"Policeman Asger Holm is answering calls at Emergency Services. He's been forced into desk duty for an unknown reason but he expects to get back to the streets tomorrow. He's callous towards the callers until he receives a call from Iben. She seems to have been kidnapped by an unknown assailant.This is a thriller on the phone. It's very effective with shocking twists and turns. I also really like the change in Asger along the way. This needs one small change in the movie. A call center like that usually has a supervisor walking the floor. As soon as Asger gets the licence plate number, he needs to hand it over to the supervisor so that he could stay on the line with the kid until the arrival of the policemen. I don't like it whenever he hangs up on the callers or put them on hold. I don't think it would be done like that. He needs a supervisor helping him out. Of course in the last act, he could still go into that room to isolate himself and heighten the tension. Overall, this is a great character thriller where all the action happens off screen."
"This is a one location movie, a telephone, and the rest is up tu your own imagination . it is excruciating, it hurts, its gutwrenching, it has moral but it has also got a few flaws, but thats just reasoning. do watch this movie,beacause its a hard genre to make a blockbuster out of. if you have seen tom hardy in ''locke'' and liked it ,well then youll dig this one.recommended"
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJakob Cedergren (Asger Holm) is a former cop, who's been demoted to working answering emergency calls after something went terribly wrong whilst on frontline duty. But he is thrust into a terrifying situation, when Iben (voiced by Jessica Dinnage) calls to say she has been kidnapped. As the call wages on, Jakob learns there may be more to it than he ever could have expected.The 'real time' technique, used in Joel Schumacher's excellent Phone Booth and John Badham's not-so-impressive Nick of Time, is used again, and to great effect, in this Continental offering from feature length debut director Gustav Moller. Euro cinema doesn't tend to get the exposure it deserves, except at various film festivals, and so goes largely unnoticed except by the arthouse crowd, leaving the mainstream minions to suckle on the next Transformers movie. Which is a shame, as it means they miss out on tight, impressive work, such as this.Moller skilfully shoots each scene without a soundtrack, adding an eerie, claustrophobic overtone to the proceedings, as they stay in the same isolated location, moving only from room to room, the story propelled along only by the dynamics of the writing and the plot developments. Its a refreshingly approached work, that relies on genuine progressions and unexpected twists to make it work, rather than all the cheap tricks pulled in your average Hollywood tripe. In the lead (and pretty much only) role, Cedergren adds an understated compassion and quiet determination as the accosted call handler.Although I have now seen it, and written a review, I don't think I picked up everything (or, in fact, quite a lot of it) and it's definitely one that will require a second viewing. I wasn't aware of its existence until the night I saw it, but I'm glad I did, much more than the inevitable naff American remake you know will end up getting made. ****"
"In a Danish response center, a policeman Asger Holm (Jakob Cedergren), who is answering emergency calls while awaiting an internal investigation, responds to Iben (Jessica Dinnage), a distraught women who has been forced into a van by her estranged husband and is being taken to an unknown location while her two young children have been left alone at home. The film follows Holm's frantic attempts to piece together the woman's situation from the fragments of information available to him. Given the nature of the film any further description or comments would include spoilers. Jakob Cedergren is very good in what is largely a one-person show, as is Jessica Dinnage as the panicked caller. The film is unusual and very well made, but while some people (like me) will find it intriguing, others will find it boring, so be warned."
"James Bond (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel what happened to Vesper, and discovers a vast mysterious worldwide organization. M (Judi Dench) is attacked, and Bond discovers a dastardly plan by wealthy Dominic Greene.This starts with an incredible action car chase, and the action keeps coming. It's intermittently interrupted by plot points which serves to be just excuses for more action. The first third has very little plot except to tell the audience that there is an evil worldwide organization. It is all action.When the bad guy is revealed, he's played by the creepy looking Mathieu Amalric. It has a lot of convoluted twists and turns. The evil plan is rather underwhelming. I am not so impressed with it. The avenging of Vesper also leaves a little to be desired. I do wish for a more concise story."
"After the ""Bond begins"" movie with Daniel Craig (also known as Casino Royal), I came to terms into where Bond was moving to. And watching Jason Bon... ah sorry I mean James Bourne of course. No, but seriously, after many years, where Bond was the one that got copied, Bond now tries to stay in touch with the times and went ""air-bo(u)rne"" (pun intended).You can hold it against this movie, as well as the fact, that Bond never get's to say his name on-screen (""Bond. James Bond""), but does that really matter? For some it does, but I think if you survived the Casino Royale deconstruction of Bond, than you should be prepared, what to expect here.I liked the raw-ness of Bond and I also liked the ending, which is so Anti-Bond, that it has an original flavour and adds to the whole thing. Of course there isn't much of a plot here ... it's a continuation to the Casino Royale story, or better it sort of concludes that. I did like the movie, because I got my head around one thing ... to rephrase a quote: ""Bond is dead, long live the (new) Bond!"" I'm not that excited about the whole thing yet, but maybe after the third one, I will be! And a movie that get's that much attention and get's discussed and even taken apart by some, has to have something going for it."
"I hate to say it, but the critic Ebert got it exactly right. This is not a very good ""007"" movie. Daniel Craig as James Bond is a good action hero, but 007 is not an action hero, he is the master of ""cool"". Ebert's review is a sort of call to restore the 007 themes to what we have come to expect, and I have to agree with him.Olga Kurylenko is the ""Bond Girl"" as Camille. (She reminded me very much of Catherine Zeta Jones in ""Mask of Zorro"", both in looks and in voice.) She is appropriately pretty and exotic, but there wasn't any real chemistry with 007.The evil one is Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene who is leading an illicit effort to corner the water supply in Bolivia, but when the movie was over neither my wife or I could explain what the story line was. There is lots of action, but it is hard to figure out why everyone is after everyone else.Unusual 007 movie."
"Quantum of Solace (2008) ** (out of 4) Weak sequel to CASINO ROYALE has Daniel Craig returning for his second stint as James Bond. This time out he must try and stop a man (Mathieu Amalric) from trying to control the water supply in the world. Or something to that effect. QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a fair movie on its own but as a Bond film it's a major disappointment on so many levels that it's really not fair to even call it a Bond movie. I mean, everything memorable about a Bond film is missing here from Q to Moneypenny to brains and thrills. This is such a strange movie to watch because it seems that the director (Marc Forster) and editors wanted to be the star of the picture. Just take a look at the opening action sequence, which really has nothing to do with anything else in the film. The scene is very fast, the edits are very quick and it's really impossible to see anything that's going on. This here is okay for an action picture but a Bond picture is supposed to have brains to where the action has the hero having to think his way out of the situation. That doesn't happen in this scene or any of the action scenes that follow and it appears that the director and editors just want to put their style all over the screen no matter how much it harms the picture. But then again, perhaps they did this because they knew the story they were working on seemed incomplete, boring and just not satisfying at all. Craig is perfect as Bond but there's just nothing he can do here. Judy Dench is fine as well but again can't save anything. Olga Kurylenko is pretty forgettable as the sexy woman and Amalric is one of the least interesting villains in the series' history. QUANTUM OF SOLICE is just a downright mess of a film and one that can easily be skipped."
"I am probably not exactly the target audience for ""Quantum of Solace"". After all, my biggest complaint about the James Bond series is that over the years the films have become more and more and more stunt-oriented (which means less and less plot-driven). While the series has always had its stunts, my favorite films are the earlier, less stunt-intensive ones. The latest batch from Daniel Craig have turned the uber-stunt craze of the films into high gear--though I did really enjoy ""Casino Royale"". I can easily understand why he suffered so many injuries during the filming of ""Quantum of SOlace""--the stunts are insane. The best of Craig's three Bond films was the first (""Casino Royale"")--the one with the least dramatic stunts and most plot. Perhaps this should tell the studio something. They might save a few dollars and make better films if they considered this.So is there much plot beyond all the action? Well, not really...or at least not much. An organization named 'QUANTUM' plans on cornering the market on oil...or water. And, like SPECTRE, they are a multinational organization dedicated to destabilizing nations and behind the scenes control of the world. Bond doesn't like them and spends the film chasing them. That's really all there is to it.I think of this film like kids who get underwear for Christmas. Their hearts are set for the big day and what did Santa bring? A bike, a new game system or a football? Nope...underwear! That is what it was like having ""Quantum of Solace"" following the wonderful Bond film ""Casino Royale""!! Too many dumb stunts, too many disconnected scenes, too little plot and practically no chance for James Craig to act, as he's always running, shooting and avoiding being shot!! A huge disappointment. And, by the way, the opening song sucked! $200,000,000 for all that?!UPDATE: After sending in this review to IMDb, I had to add one more thing. At the end of the film, Bond has captured the guy responsible for EVERYTHING and lets him go to a possible death or not! What the $%** was that?! Who thought this was an appropriate way to end the film?!"
"Well, if you enjoyed the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"" movie, then you will certainly enjoy the 2021 movie ""The Suicide Squad"" as well. Why? Well, simply put, because it is the same kind of cheesy entertainment.Writer and director James Gunn definitely managed to keep the movie up to par with the 2016 predecessor in terms of oddball characters, an outrageous script and an abundance of action.It should be said though that the 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"" is a step up in terms of graphic violence and sheer mayhem. For better or worse, then ""The Suicide Squad"" was rather bloody and gory. That was something I had not expected from the movie, but it was definitely something I welcomed to the movie, as it just felt rightly at place in the cheesy movie.The storyline told in ""The Suicide Squad"" is a no-brainer, and very much reminiscent of the 2016 movie. So this is essentially a movie where you lean back, munch the popcorn and just enjoy the action-packed ride.I can't claim that I was particularly impressed with the bad guy, villain or whatever you want to call a starfish of that size and magnitude. Sure, it made for some great spectacle of destruction, but the creature itself and the concept of it was just a bit far out there. But hey, then again, anything is possible in these movies I suppose.The characters in ""The Suicide Squad"" were colorful and bizarre, to say the least. And that was something that I definitely enjoyed in this 2021 movie, as they upped the character gallery quite a lot in comparison to the 2016 movie.I feel that Harley Quinn (played by
Margot Robbie) was a bit underplayed in this movie, as her character wasn't really given enough time to show the usual level of whacky crazy that we saw in the other movies.The Bloodsport character (played by
Idris Elba) was definitely one of the more detailed and layered characters in the movie, and let's just be honest here, Idris Elba was superbly cast for this particular role and performed it so well. It was fun to watch Michael Rooker portraying the Savant character in the movie, despite of not having all that much screen time.Then there was the King Shark character. When I first saw him, I must admit that I was ready to face palm myself. But as the movie progressed, I must admit that the character grew on me, and he definitely was a good comedy relief in the movie. And of course having Sylvester Stallone to do the voice was just great.I am not much of a fan of John Cena and his 'acting', but the character he portrayed in ""The Suicide Squad"" was actually a well-written character and one that felt very much in place in the movie.Having mentioned King Shark, I also have to mention the Weasel (played by Sean Gunn). Wow, what a character. He was something unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen, both in terms of appearance, mannerisms and what part he played in the movie. This character was just glorious. But I bet there will be a lot of people out there disliking the character. But, to each their own.And it was really, really nice to see actor Joaquín Cosio in the movie, taking on the part as Mayor General Mateo Suarez. This guy seriously is a great actor, and a much underrated one at that. He was so nicely cast for the movie and brought a lot of flavor to the screen.Visually then ""The Suicide Squad"" is great. Of course it is great, given it being a D. C. movie about anti-heroes.I must admit that I wasn't initially expecting all that much from writer and director James Gunn's 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"", but it proved to be rather enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.My rating of ""The Suicide Squad"" lands on a six out of ten stars - or starfish..."
"In my review of the 2016 film, I noted that I wasn't inspired by it enough to check out a sequel if there was one. Well, now it's here and I'm back to the party, and by the look of things, this sequel clearly outdoes the original with a significantly higher IMDb rating. That's not to say parts of it aren't cheesy, they definitely are, when you consider two of your meta-human heroes are a land walking shark and a guy who kills with polka dots. That King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone) had me reminiscing all the way back to those old time Saturday Night Live skits that used to crack me up. The kicker had to be the super villain who shows up in the latter half, and my word! - Starro the Conqueror finally made it into a DC flick! Starro's first appearance in a comic book story hearkens all the way back to March, 1960 in an issue of Brave and the Bold #28, in which it went up against the Justice League! How's that for longevity, sixty plus years of history for a giant starfish!I have to admit, the opening sequence was a little awkward with the first team being taken out so handily by the Corto Maltese military faction. But then the real Task Force X showed up to side with Sol Soria's (Alice Braga) freedom fighters. After that, it's one major dust up after another, with a couple of surprise outcomes that get further treatment in the after credits scene.As for the story, that's where it gets somewhat derivative. The American government in league with a foreign nation to suppress information about a top secret project that could be used for military purposes? Come on, that's like saying the NIH would fund a secret Chinese lab to engage in gain of function research. Oh, wait..."
"The problem with superhero movies. They can easily be po faced and pompous. The audience want fun from their superheroes.Marvel learned this hence why the colourful Thor 3 was such a contrast from Thor 2.James Gunn injected a lot of frivolous fun in the Guardian of the Galaxy movies.Even 20th Century Fox went off the wall with Deadpool. An X Man giving the middle finger to X Men movies.Only Warner Brothers and DC have ploughed on with movies lacking the fun factor.It's James Gunn to the rescue with The Suicide Squad, the follow on to the 2016 original.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Bloodsport (Idris Elba) Peacemaker (John Cena) and some others including a shark that likes to eat humans become part of Task Force X assembled once again by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis.)Their mission is to infiltrate the island of Corto Maltese which recently had a coup. It also has a facility with something alien inside. To find out more they need to get to the Thinker (Peter Capaldi.)This is a zippy action movie that eschews the traditional three act structure. It plays fast and loose. It's faithful to its comic book origins.It is violent and darkly comic. It also has a lot of heart thanks to Elba and Daniela Melchior who plays Ratcatcher 2.Despite what looks like a scattergun approach Gunn also manages to add some political subtext to the film."
"What can be said about the Suicide Squad (yes the, not a or just Suicide Squad) ... and what can be said about James Gunn? I reckon some may have issues with his work - and that is fine. We all have different tastes. Him going comedy (though very dark and very violent and so many other things that certain people may call inappropriate) - is quite different from what Zac Snyder and DC stood for mostly. But succesful DC movies (at least at the box office) had quite a lot of fun included too - like Shazam to name another.But this is not that - we also have the previous Suicide Squad ... which while not really referred to, is in this too. Because you have some of the former members here. But of course a lot of new people too. The characters are as crazy as they can be - and the movie is as bloody as it is allowed too - it also has some nudity in it. The US has the R rating for movies like this ... UK and Germany went for the 15 and 16 rating respectively ... which some may find a bit low. That will depend on your sensibilities ... just be aware that there is a lot of gore, blood and other ""mature"" things depicted.The movie is not taking any prisoners (almost in a literal sense) and you never know who is going to bite the dust/bullet ... maybe even a member that you like a lot ... not to mention that morals are not really an issue for most members to say the least. Stick for an extra scene after the credits ... it does set up a future project (maybe it's already in the past when you read this)"
"Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is back with the Suicide Squad. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) blackmails Bloodsport (Idris Elba) onto the team. Along with Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the group is tasked with infiltrating the island state of Corto Maltese after a military coup to take out an alien starfish.This is a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question."
"This is an entertaining film. Both Cruella and the Baroness have distinct personalities. They are wicked, but not so much that puts you off."
"I went in to the cinema expecting to be disappointed, or to nod off, but I have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's dark, it's funny, it's utterly entertaining. It just goes to show that when film makers are given an imaginative script, the magic can still happen.Emma Stone, she gets lots of parts, and you can see why, she's so good, she's excellent in this, and really does inject some vigour into the character.How nice it was to be back in a cinema!This exceeded my expectations, 8/10."
"Estella (Emma Stone) was born with usual black and white hair. Her mother keeps warning her against turning to the evil side known as Cruella. The rebellious young girl lost her mother in a Dalmatian attack. She finds a fashion mentor in The Baroness (Emma Thompson) who turns into her rival and then her oppressor.Disney reworking their villains come with some issues. The obvious one for this character is dogs. It does come up with an interesting solution. Now I don't remember Cruella having dogs herself and that threw me off. Killing off her mother with Dalmatians seems to be overkill. At that point, I was going to murder this movie if it made the Dalmatians into villains and excuses. Quite frankly, non of that is necessary as the solution is very simple and very effective. I would have liked The Baroness to pitch the idea of 101 Dalmatians to Walt Disney but that may be going too far.In the end, this is a very good reworking but it is a lot of road to cover. I was so intrigued with little Estella that she would have been plenty enough for a whole movie herself. It would be an interesting battle between Estella and Cruella. It could have been a Carrie revenge story against her school tormentors. A young Cruella movie may have been a better option."
"Kudos for some creative (not done before repeatedly) storytelling although the petty theft ""poor stealing from the rich"" angle is old. I question the premise in storylines that it's acceptable (as well as getting away with it) in either direction (poor from rich, or rich from poor) to steal. The Sia look goes all the way back to ""The One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", and ""101 Dalmatians"". Many other storyline references also harken back to the original movies.Many negative reviews related to DVD issues."
"Origin stories are where it's at. I don't know who started doing origin stories, but certainly Marvel has to get credit for popularizing it. As for Disney, they have rolled out a few origin stories with Cruella being the latest.I really enjoyed this movie. I think I may have enjoyed it even more than my eleven-year-old daughter who liked it as well. The movie was definitely made with parents in mind as the plot is a bit much for a child to keep up with.Cruella (Emma Stone) was born Estella. When her mom was killed by three vicious dalmatians Estella was left an orphan. She quickly hooked up with a couple of young thieves named Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser). The three of them grew up together grifting on the streets of London and all was good. Estella began to make a slow transformation into Cruella after working for The Baroness (Emma Thompson) who was as cold as ice. The Baroness was the top fashion designer in England (or maybe the world) and the cruelest woman you ever did see. She reminded me of a meaner Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) from ""The Devil Wears Prada.""""Cruella"" was well thought out and brilliantly put together. There weren't many laughs though the movie stayed light most of the time. There were a few moments where the movie was a bit dark and heavy, far darker and heavier than any rendition of ""101 Dalmatians"" ever was. Still, the movie stayed out of really serious and somber waters. A testament for me that the movie was good was that I enjoyed it even with Emma Stone playing the lead; an actress who I have yet to like in any movie. But I have to give credit where credit is due; she was down right good in ""Cruella."""
"""Infinite"" is a brainless and senseless action-sci-fi film. The flawed plot is a complete mess, without character development, but based on an interesting premise: an original view of reincarnation. Unfortunately, the reason why the villain Bathurst, performed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, does exist is amazingly stupid. Bathurst wants to destroy the mankind and all the living things on Earth since he has been bored of reincarnating for three hundred years. However, he has a bullet that holds the souls of who is shot in a chip, avoiding the soul to reborn and reincarnate again. So why doesn't he commit suicide with this bullet and avoid all the troubles. What is the purpose of existing The Believers other than seek out for the egg to avoid the destruction of life on Earth? Therefore, to like the story, the viewer needs to turn off the brain and watch the good CGI only. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Infinito"" (""Infinite"")"
"You'd think with the lack of choice in blockbuster films over this pandemic, people would be more appreciative one comes out that is packed with action and fun, and has an A-list cast. But no, instead everyone is comparing this film to other movies in disappointment.Who cares, just turn your brain down, grab some popcorn and a bevy, and sit back and enjoy the ride. Sure some CGI wasn't great, but when a film has a budget (Wahlberg's salary?), I'm sure some cuts were needed to stay within it.The 106 min runtime flew by with the perfect pacing. Cinematography was on point. The writing/story was fun and refreshing with decent action. How can anyone say they couldn't understand it, or that there were many plot holes. I understood it perfectly, and saw zero issues with the plot. In fact, I thought the story was very cohesive with great continuity, and flowed smoothly and effectively.Contrary to what the critics said, Antoine Fuqua's directing was spot on. Casting was decent and Wahlberg with all other cast performed great and were convincing. Whichever film you plop Jason Mantzoukas in, he does not disappoint, and his role as the Artisan will certainly draw some smiles.I wasn't impressed with the score, and it sounded very B-film-like, and I was getting annoyed at that constant very distinct Transformers sound effect. It wasn't necessary and very out of place.Nevertheless, it was a fun and entertaining film, and I certainly will recommend it for a one time watch. It's a well deserved 7.5 rounded up to an 8/10 from me."
"You've already seen this movie before, only it was with immortals or vampires or secret societies or some bull like that, yet my guess is that you've seen a better version of it. Infinite is a pure made for money, soulless and ultimately pointless production. The premise is magical in nature, but the entire film is about fast cars and futuristic weapons. The story itself is filled with logic holes, the action is underwhelming - minus a car chase at the start which was actually good, the acting is either bad or over the top and the human resource is underused.This is not one of those angry reviews for a movie I hate. I do not hate this movie. It's just really really dumb and I wish it was better. Against all odds I actually like Mark Wahlberg, but he keeps making incredibly idiotic films. Chiwetel Ejiofor actually tried to carry this entire thing on his acting and he couldn't. But look at all the other known names in this film: Dylan O'Brien is present only for the starting car chase scene that I mentioned above. He does a great job, then he dies. Rupert Friend is also in that, with much much less screen time. Toby Jones appears two times. I don't know Wallis Day, but I see that she played in quite a lot of series and she is highly rated; she says like three things in the entire thing. What happens in the rest of the movie, you ask? CGI establishing shots or tech that doesn't get explained or really used, random car chases and shootings and sword fights, almost unrelated to one another and without any sense and bad bored ""please shoot me"" acting.Bottom line: avoid this like the plague."
5 out of 5 stars.Infinite is an awesome science fiction action film that delivers an interesting concept about reincarnation and people having the abilities to remember there past lives. While there a group of bad guys lead by Chiwetel Ejiofor who are trying to retrieve a weapon that can eliminate all life. While Mark Wahlberg discovers that his past lives have been in an everlong battle trying to save it.Great plot. Seems similiar to other science fiction films like The Old Guard. And how reincarnation plays a factor and there are two groups of people who have the ability to remember there lives. One that is trying to end that life cycle and one trying to save it.The cast ensemble is great. Mark Wahlberg takes up the action role and delivers. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a great villain. Sophie Cookson. And Jason Mantzoukas did good as well. Rupert Fiend and Dylan O Brien were good with there short roles.Antoine Fuqua did great with this action film. Definitely would be a summer blockbuster film. Lots of mindless action. Car chases and shoot outs. Fast paced. And a thrill ride that never slows down. The film is exciting. Loud. And it is what you can expect for a mindless action flick.
"""Infinites"" are people who have achieved a form of immortality through reincarnation. They have split into two groups in a battle of good versus evil. Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg) has always have knowledge beyond his experience. He forges a sword for a drug dealer in exchange for illegal meds to keep his sanity. He gets arrested and attacked by Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is saved by Nora Brightman who brings him into the world of the Infinites.This seems to have an intriguing elevator pitch. It's the story of reincarnation as a superhero movie. So the start seems fine. The drug dealer, the police station, and the epic escape are all fine. Once the movie starts doing expositions, it completely stalls. Wahlberg starts reverting back to his Wahlberg mannerisms. It's the blandest of action thrillers and the most bombastic. It takes any hint of original concept and turns it into forgettable non-descript action."
"""Oh, greatest of Kings, let one of your Knights try to land a blow against me. Indulge me in this game."" The Green Knight (Ralph Ineson)Over the years, The Green Knight may become the Citizen Kane of Arthurian epics on screen.I am confident English majors like me will love this mighty tale. Based on a 14th century anonymous poem, Gawain and The Green Knight, it crystallizes our fascination with the Arthurian legend, the achievement of heroic status for young men, and the mystery of death. Those heavy-duty themes, however, don't have to put off the non-English majors, who will enjoy at the very least the exceptional cinematography, romantic journey, and dynamic Dev Patel, an inspired choice even if it isn't Adam Driver.GATGK could serve as a fine example of ""epic"" if you consider the virtue of the hero, the trappings of court, the magical episodes, and the outlines of a culture in transition from The Middle Ages to the Renaissance. Anyhow, it's simply a powerful story starting with the entrance of The Green Knight, a towering tree-like warrior with a voice to make Morgan Freeman envious.Once Gawain lops of his head in a challenging game, epic takes over as Gawain takes the year till they must meet again by experiencing an accelerated, episodic life journey bringing him face to face with a talking fox, a seductive Lady (Alicia Vikander), who looks like his fav prostitute, deceptive scavengers, enigmatic naked giants, and the Green Knight himself. Homer's Odysseus, much more experienced than Gawain, managed to get himself caught with similarly fantastic creatures and ladies but had far more fun than Gawain by virtue of his maturity and unimaginable ingenuity.All of which shows GATGK to be a learning journey for Gawain, as if the poet wished to show the maturing of any man in his display of courage and honor. Writer/director David Lowery gives his talented actors and gorgeous set design full reign to create a first-rate legendary story and one of the best movies of the year."
"There should be a law that forbids Hollywood to maim European history, tales and legends. I am not talking about the main actor - The Green Knight has nothing to do (story-wise) with the great epics of medieval Europe but is one of those mass produced movies with some nice cinematography and effects but no real or good story. Like the last Arthur movie by Guy Ritchie (same procedure - take a well known character of literature or history but change everything else to your gusto), The Green Knight shows hard, that good story-writing is an craft and art that is not known and managed by many these days. Mediocrity hidden behind a veil of pseudo-intellectualism."
"""The Green Knight"" is a new movie in fact that just hit cinemas here and it is a co-production between Ireland, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and with this quartet nobody can really be surprised that it from beginning to end in the English language, even if thick accents are very frequent here. But let's take a look at the basics first: The writer and director is American filmmaker David Lowery, who has really received many accolades and awards now over the years and he launched his career as an editor, so it should not really surprise anybody that he also worked as an editor on this film here and on many other not too long ago, even if he has progressed to being the man in charge of the entire project as well. The title character is played by Dev Patel, who had his breakthrough with Slumdog Millionaire over a decade ago now, a film that won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Since then, he has also managed to score Oscar nominations himself and it is also kinda funny to compare his bearded self in 2021 with the boy he was back then briefly before the 2010s. He is in almost every scene from this movie from beginning to end and the only lead. Here and there, he is joined by the stunning Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander. Joel Edgerton is also always easy to identify and I kinda like the screen presence he has and the energy he usually brings to his roles. When he comments on the main character's language, there is also a really rare moment of comedy here almost. Not a funny movie. Does not aspire to be such. Back to the cast, there are other familiar faces like Barry Keoghan who you could recognize if you saw his Yorgos Lanthimos movie. He is easy to identify really, seemed to be a bit of a clumsy friend in his first scene, there to maybe to get in some comic relief, but turned out he is something else entirely.Keoghan is by the way an actor who originates from Ireland and this is why he also fit very nicely in this film. This is a really Irish movie, not only because of the strong presence of the color green, but also because of the names of locations and characters. Even Dev Patel, who is really everything but Irish, plays a character named Gawain. Enough said. By the way, he is not the title character, is he? I'm not sure. There is constantly talk about him (not) being a knight, but I kept thinking it's maybe the one who shows up initially to submit this challenge. That character, who we also see in the end again luckily, was almost more memorable to me than Patel's. He looked so amazing visually and everything fit there and I would immediately watch a film about this character. Great voice as well. Or how they show us the method through which the queen reads this very special letter at the beginning. And how it exhausts her right away when she is finished as if some evil spirit possessed her. You can discuss if this tree-like creature is evil. At least he has red blood as we see when he is decapitated. Or seemed to have been decapitated initially. And of course he did not feel any fear. He knew he could stay alive, maybe thanks to his magical axe. That axe was also a really nice inclusion. I mean look at tiny little plants coming out of the area around it when it is laid down. That was a really small moment, but great attention to detail and memorable as a consequence. Also, you must understand that this is not a superhero movie, evven if it is a fantasy movie. It may come easy to think of The Green Hornet, Green Lantern, Green Arrow... when reading the title, but it turns out something completely different. But still good.There are not too many flaws for me with this film, even if it also did not reach greatness for me overall. Or too rarely. I struggled a bit for example with how quickly the main character has a bit of a falling-out with Edgerton's character or also with the fox immediately afterwards who seemed like a loyal companion before that. That came a bit surprising for sure, but maybe also indicates how nothing is safe in terms of belonging and friendship when the adventure continues. Probably our hero here was a bit of a loner. Maybe also that is why he did not really have too much to lose when accepting the strange visitor's proposal and he was the only one who did. I just mentioned the fox. That one I have to go with again. I liked the scene in which he was introduced in a way with this woman who was actually a spirit. Also I really liked the way the fox was animated. Incredibly cute. I want that one in my life. But this animal also symbolized in a way that the protagonist did not want to be 100% alone as we see when he allows the fox (never know if I should say ""he"", ""she"" or ""it"", but one thing is safe: I won't say ""they"") to enter. Other highlights from this film except the little fox was the scene in which the ruthless fighter introduced himself and came to visit the king and bring him this letter. You could see that he was not scared at all because he knew he would get out there alive 100%. His laughter actually sounded on the evil side. The king asking the male protagonist before that to come sit with him did feel a bit random though, even if he was his nephew. The connection with the young man's mother and how she is potentially a witch. Well, that I was not too big on or added very little from me.Then there is the color green. Many beautiful shots including this. One I remember in particular is towards the end when out hero(?) is there and sees the creature he has been looking for. We see this shot in two different shades of green basically. Also Vikander's speech on the significance of the color green in nature, but also how men see it and react to it, was a true highlight. Vikander turned that monologue into something truly memorable and haunting. Big thumbs-up to her and that powerful scene alone proved that she is among the finest actresses from her generation as of now without a doubt. As I am getting closer to the end of this review, let me say a few words about the ending. It seemed like a lightning-speed fast-forward look at the coming decades when the protagonist returns and becomes kking, but his cowardice always haunts him and eventually also has him lose his head. So he will be headless no matter what. Then we see it was really just a what-if, a premonition you could say. There Lowery also toys a bit with the audience. When the forest creature compliments the boy that he finally understood and made the right choice, you could think that the crucial blow would be nothing devastating or murderous, but it probably is. We do not know 100% because this is where the film ends. With how he goes for him before that, I cannot imagine though that he let him live. By the way, I also liked there how the forest creature basically sits on his throne this calmly when Patel's character shows up. He has all the time in the world really and now all his focus is on resting, maybe sleeping. And the ""aye"" as an answer to this crucial question instead of a ""yes"" I appreciated too.So yeah, all in all a pretty good movie. I see critics liked these over two hours much more than general audiences apparently. I am not sure if I am surprised or not. I think this film has the potential for an even higher rating on rewatch and it feels like a very rewatchable movie that offers a great deal of quality even if you know the ending. Maybe especially if you know the ending. Perhaps then also some scenes will become bit clearer like what happened with the thieves in the forest (or their leader I should say) after they stole the axe. Or what was the meaning of the skeleton. We will see. But there is not the flightest doubt for my positive recommendation this time. It gets a thumbs-up for sure and I suggest you check this one out and as I am not always big on fantasy films, this mans something. Well done to Lowery and everybody else involved with the production and shooting of this one here. It also felt shorter to me which is always a good sign, especially when a movie crosses not only the 100-minute mark, but even the 120-minute mark. And pretty comfortably in fact. It's closer to two hours and fifteen minutes. A success from every perspective, no matter which one you look at: sound effects, direction, story, acting, visual effects, make-up, costumes, cinematography. I think it could score several Oscar nominations next year. And deservedly so. If I am not mistaken, it wasn't eligible yet for the 2021 Academy Awards."
"Greetings again from the darkness. If you are at all inclined to see this movie, then I would encourage you to do so ... and brace yourself for a surreal and mystical treat unlike any other medieval tale previously adapted for the big screen. Writer-director David Lowery re-teams with A24, the studio that also distributed his critically-acclaimed 2017 film, A GHOST STORY, to deliver a trip for your senses based on the tale of Sir Gawain - a tale that's been told in various and often contradictory ways over many years.Dev Patel (LION, 2016) stars as Gawain, the nephew of an ailing King Arthur (Sean Harris, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT, 2018) and Guinevere (Kate Dickie, THE WITCH, 2015). When not imbibing with his friends, shaggy Gawain spends his time in the throes of intimacy with his paramour, Essel (Oscar winner Alicia Vikander sporting a pixie do). Young Gawain feels unworthy when he's amongst the knights and dreams of becoming an important man, so that he too may regale the King with his tales of adventure.Gawain's mother (Sarita Choudhury), in an attempt to facilitate her son's dreams, uses her witchcraft to conjure up his first opportunity for greatness ... and the film's first visually stunning moment. We are mesmerized as The Green Knight (Ralph Ineson, THE WITCH, 2015) makes his entrance riding a great steed into the room where the Knights are gathered at their Round Table. The Green Knight, best described as a giant Groot (from GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY), puts forth a challenge that only Gawain is willing to take up. The scene is stunning and memorable, and allows Gawain one year of celebrity before the second part of the challenge must be faced.It's at this point where Gawain sets off on his journey ... one that can be likened to Homer's ""The Odyssey"", in that it's filled with surprises and obstacles that defy logic and explanation. The surprises include: Barry Keoghan (DUNKIRK, 2017) as a garrulous, yet deceitful forest scavenger; the ghost of St Winifred (Erin Kellyman) requesting help locating her skull in the swamp; scantily-clad (CGI) bald-headed giants slowly roaming the forest; and a Lord (Joel Edgerton) and his mistress who offer shelter and advice that may or may not be helpful. Also on his journey to meet back up with The Green Knight, Gawain is accompanied by a red fox that holds his own surprises.Director Lowery's film is a surreal, hypnotic medieval becoming-a-man tale that is both epic and intimate. There is much to unwrap here, including the witches who clearly establish women's control of men, and the idea that some may view themselves as destined for greatness, but blink when the moment of truth arrives. We do get a glimpse of Excalibur, and Lowery's frequent collaborator Daniel Hart's excellent score expertly blends with the infusion of metal music. The film requires the heightened use of your senses, and the fascinating work of cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo keeps us zoned in on each character and every scene.In theaters Friday, July 30, 2021."
"As most artisanal movies go, the visually were breathtaking, with this aura hanging over ever scene. However, the storyline plot and dialogue were downright nonsensical, what the hell were even half those scenes about? I have no idea. Made no sense, I got lost and bored ten minutes in."
"I reckon it is or will be easy to dismiss what happens here for some. Unfortunately that does not make the things that are depict in here untrue. From a male perspective you may see different valid points throughout this ... you may feel that certain things do not apply to you. And maybe they don't - that doesn't mean that they don't exist. I know it feels like I'm repeating myself ... something the movie does avoid.Which is quite the feat, considering what it is about and how she goes on a hunt (prowl?) at nights ... I was not sure what she was doing and the movie did leave it upon a bit ... but it does clear up during the runtime. Now she is broken and we slowly get why that is. It is revealed in the right way, even while we do sort of know or feel that we know most of it.What is a nice touch, we never see anything in that regard. There is no sleaze, there is no (visible) exploitation going on. That does not mean it is easy to watch ... or listen to what is happening. I personally am not a fan of the term feminist, but this movie may change your mind regarding that or other things.There are borderline things happening and our main character is not perfect. That does not mean she does not deserve something good ... and it does look like she can have. If she can bring herself to let go ... on the other hand, there is more than meets the eye. Way more ... and the ending ... I'm not going to spoil it for you, but let's say I did not expect that at all.Very well told and truths that do hurt ... but are essential to be seen ... and learned from (hopefully)"
"""Promising Young Woman"" is a co-production between the UK and USA in the English language and a fairly new release. Well, it is released these days (two weeks from now with the wide release) here in Germany, even if the world premiere happened a long time ago already, last year in fact. This film that is not considerably under two hours long was one of the big players during the previous awards season and in the end it ended up winning one Oscar and many other awards. Could have been more Oscars, could have been less. It took home the screenplay win in a category that was truly packed with movies that would have been contenders almost every year perhaps. Carey Mulligan was considered a frontrunner for a long time as well, but Best Actress was really wide open this year and in the end, Frances McDormand took it, the lead from the Best Picture winner. I like her too, but I think I would have been happier with Mulligan winning. Followed her since her breakthrough in An Education over a decade ago. It's okay though. Really nice to see her back so strongly and I hope one day she will win the Oscar. And I hope even more that she will keep delivering quality movies like this one here. This was a stunning example of how she is definitely among the very best actress from her generation. Just like how she was in her 20s. Still a bit unusual for me to see her with long blond hair this time, but hey it makes sense. Works better with the story than the tame brown hair she usually shows. So she is one of two key women attached to this movie. The second is Emerald Fennell, the writer and director and a prolific actress herself in fact. She was a recent Emmy nominee for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles on The Crown and also appeared in the Oscar-winning The Danish Girl for example. Another actress to manage a really successful transition from acting into writing and directing. It's not just Greta Gerwig. Her Best Director nomination this time was also a bit of a surprise, but probably not a negative one. Same goes for her Bets Screenplay win. There the nomination was always safe.As for the rest of the cast, nobody is as much at the center of the film as Mulligan. (I still find the meaning of her last name kinda funny. Sounds like ""mullet"", but means something entirely different.) Burnham also has a lot of screen time and may be the closest to a co-lead. He scored no less than five Emmy nominations this year for his variety special, actually six if you count the biggest nomination too, but came short in all of those. So also a man with many talents apparently. He has such a familiar face. Every time I see him, I keep wondering where I know him from and it feels as if I have watches a series with 100 episodes and he was in each and every single one of them, but I didn't. Alison Brie I must admit I did not recognize here. Surely one of the biggest names from the cast. Mintz-Plasse is another one always easy to identify, even if he has only one scene and he was creepy and funny at the same time somehow with how disgusting his character really was. Fennell herself has a really small cameo in here. I did not know the actress before, so I did not recognize her either. Molina is a delight as always, especially if he plays kind-hearted characters. Also nice reunion with him and Mulligan from An Education. Greenfield ugh I think he was one of really not many weaknesses here. He has a key scene basically, the night after the tragedy, and he really does not nail it. They should have picked a more talented actor there. I also never saw something special about him on New Girl. At least he played a really unlikable character and it was fairly easy to hate him with the actor in charge. Britton some will recognize. I did not really recognize her, even if her one scene was not bad and kinda challenging too. Many familiar names and faces here, even if most do not have a lot of screen time. Cox plays the best friend. Tolerable, nothing special and mostly in it for slight comic relief, exactly her niche you could say, but maybe receiving the protagonist's chain in the end was a bit too much. And Coolidge I have to mention as well. Love her in everything. She was good her too, with the drama and lighter moments. That dinner with the two parents, their daughter and her potential boyfriend was an absolute riot. Pure comedy gold.As for the movie itself, it was very nicely done. Needs a little bit to get going and you wonder what she really does. I mean she could not have killed all these men if you look at the amount in her little book, so yeah she just exposes and humiliates them somehow to deal with her suffering and grief and her past with what happened to her best friend. Even the latter's mother says she must stop. But once you know about her motivations, it all makes sense sort of. Mulligan played the part so well. Also interesting to see a high-quality movie delivering not only an awesome ""It's Raining Men"" cover, but also turning Paris Hilton into a somewhat creative artist, even if it's more of a guilty pleasure to be honest. I also liked how this film was really unexpected when crucial events happened. It gets you. It really does. Be it Burnham's character being part of the group of men who watched the abuse back then or be it only how he reacts and openly calls Mulligan's character a failure when he realizes that he won't get her back with what happened. Okay, maybe him running into her in front of the club was a bit too much of a coincidence honestly. But the killing at the end sure was really unexpected for me. Not at the very end. I mean you can really discuss if she started the entire thing with the idea to get killed, so in terms of a planned suicide. How she is fighting for her life under that pillow does not mean that she did not want to die. Everybody would do so there because it's a reflex. But they (or she, namely Fennell) found a good way to close the film with the closest to a happy ending there could be. The offenders are caught, again Greenfield's running away was rather cringeworthy, even if it was meant in a funny way, and they will be on trial for murder and also her potential boyfriend (Burham) will get his fair share because he lied to the police and was part of the group back then too. I guess how Greenfield and the male antagonist (the groom) disposed of the body made it easy to see there will be a murder charge, even if you could also make an argument of course that honestly if somebody is about to attack you with a scalpel and one of your arms is still tied to a bedpost, it could be considered self defence. Or at least spur of the moment. We don't find out as this is not a courtroom drama.The one thing this film has on almost every other movie dealing with a similar subject is that it feels really creative and inspired. And of course that these other films do not have Carey Mulligan in the lead. But these other films almost always feel for the sake of it. Like they elaborate on #metoo, on violence against women, on gender discrimination etc. But this is what they rely on. They rely on the film being seen as impressive and relevant because of said subject(s). And often the story, writing and overall outcome could not be any more shallow and simple sadly and the films are still praised because the mainstream media simply want to keep the momentum going when it comes to these inclusions. And also because they are maybe scared to say that a film on these issues can indeed suck. Suck a lot even because many do. This one here is the exact opposite. There is no hesitation for me here at all when it comes to decising if I should give the film a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. The only question was if it is a good or great film. I actually go with the latter now because I really enjoyed it. I don't think it's a flawless film and it was a really close call admittedly, but for now I'd say it's great and it's even my favorite 2020 release. So big thumbs-up here. The attention to detail was also overwhelming at times.This is also not only on these currently very relevant issues I just mentioned, but also compleetly aside from that a quite interesting revenge thriller. And a very different one. I mean it's not bloody, even if they (Mulligan and Fennell) played a little bit early on with us when we see ketchup on her mouth and can wonder if it's blood, but her recenge is just an expression of misery you could say. The character wants others to feel as bad as she does. One after the other and eventually her revenge is not only against men in general (come on, at least the name we remember, most other stuff too probably), but against those directly linked to what happened with her best friend. She meets all kinds of different reactions there. Professionalism, indifference, regret etc. And her reactions are also different. Looks like she hired a guy to beat up Molina's character? But the latter is one really showing remorse saying how he cannot sleep anymore, how he has not been able to sleep properly for years. I feel him. I don't fucntion without enough sleep either. Anyway, drifting away now. One of the best things this film delivers is how it renders the ""we were still kids"" element pointless. And how she makes it personal. How she does not let the boys get away with their actions this time again. And how she lets nobody in the audicen leave the cinema without a lump in their throats, but also with a feeling of satisfaction because the good guys win in the end. Police in this case. Or justice, even if again I must say we do not see anybody found guilty inside a courtroom in this movie. That is all now. I highly recommend checking this one out. It turned really dark in the last half hour, maybe 45 minutes even, but it just got better this way. Big thumbs-up! Oh and Margot Robbie produced this btw. Fitting. Nurse Carey looks a bit like Harley Quinn. Still glad Robbie did not star, even if I don't dislike her anymore like I once did."
"Powerful, potent & provocative, Emerald Fennell's feature film debut is as vivid as it is vicious in its storytelling and is greatly elevated by Carey Mulligan's ferocious showcase. A bold & brilliant revenge thriller that's unyielding in its intensity yet is aware of what lines to not cross, Promising Young Woman is undeniably amongst the better films of 2020.Also written by Fennell, the story is riveting, unforgiving & timely plus the drama only gets more interesting as it progresses before culminating with a finale that's going to polarise its viewers. Fennell's tactful direction makes sure the dark mood & reckoning feel never leaves the room and the way it builds up to its inescapable climax is thoroughly engrossing to watch.The neat camerawork, vibrant lighting, tight editing & splendid musical choices are no doubt impressive and bring a certain richness & depth to the imagery as well. The real standout however is Carey Mulligan's show-stealing performance that hits all the right notes and is up there with her best works. The supporting cast is no slouch but Mulligan's strong act easily overshadows them all.Overall, Promising Young Woman is gripping, thrilling & thought-provoking from start to finish and commences Emerald Fennell's feature filmmaking career on an incredibly promising note. A refreshing slice of abuse, trauma & retribution that's expertly crafted & confidently narrated by its debutant director and is catapulted to new heights by Carey Mulligan's fierce & fervent act, Promising Young Woman is a definite must-see."
"A mostly different film in many ways, but my reaction to Promising Young Woman reminds me of the first time I saw Gone Girl and how I thought at first that I hated the ending but in fact, it's the perfect closer to an incredible ride of revenge from the lead character. Exquisitely directed by Emerald Fennell and led by the performance of a career in Carey Mulligan, PYW is a force to be reckoned with in 2020/2021. The wait was well worth it.9.5/10."
"The Oscar and Golden Globe nominated directorial debut for actress Emerald Fennell (Call the Midwife, The Crown) was making news not long before it got caught in Awards Season, because of its ""female empowerment"" theme, and the controversial story to bring it to light, I was looking forward to seeing it. Basically, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Thomas (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Carey Mulligan, also producing) is a thirty-year-old medical school dropout who lives an uneventful existence, still living with her parents Stanley (Clancy Brown) and Susan (Jennifer Coolidge). She also works a dead-end job as a waitress at a cheap coffee shop with her only friend Gail (Laverne Cox). But secretly, Cassie spends her nights pretending to be drunk, and helpless in clubs, allowing men to take her to their homes. When the men are about to take advantage of her, she reveals her sobriety and shocks them, making them think twice next time they approach a vulnerable woman. At the coffee shop, Cassie is reunited with a former medical school classmate, Ryan Cooper (Bo Burnham). After some banter, Cassie spits in Ryan's coffee, but he still drinks it anyway and asks to take her out. She gives him a fake phone number. Meanwhile, Stanley and Susan continually express concerns over Cassie's lack of ambitions and hint that she should move out. Ryan returns to the coffee shop after realising Cassie gave him a fake number, she has a change of heart and agrees to go out with him. Although Ryan appears nice enough, Cassie doesn't let him get too close to her. During a conversation, Ryan mentions his old colleague Alexander ""Al"" Monroe (Chris Lowell), who is getting married. Years earlier, Al raped her best friend Nina Fisher, who was too drunken to know what she was doing. Cassie and Nina reported it, but it was not taken seriously and there was no investigation by the school or legal system. This led to Nina committing suicide and Cassie dropping out of medical school and faking drunkenness in clubs to catch out other predatory men. Cassie is disturbed and begins a plan to exact revenge on Al and the other people who she knows were involved in the aftermath of Nina's rape. She meets another former classmate and friend, Madison McPhee (Alison Brie), who did not believe Nina was raped. Cassie gets Madison drunk and hires a man to take Madison to a hotel room. Madison has no memory of what happened and leaves several distraught voicemails for Cassie, concerned she was raped herself. Cassie next lures her teenager Amber into her car by posing as a makeup artist for her favourite pop band. Amber is the daughter of Elizabeth Walker (Connie Britton), the medical school dean who dismissed Nina's case for lack of evidence. She meets Walker pretending that she wants to resume her education, and questions her about Nina's case. When Walker explains away her actions, Cassie tells her she dropped Amber off at a dorm room with a group of older drunk male students. Walker is terrified for her daughter's safety and tries to call Amber, only to see that Cassie has it. In fear, she apologises for her inaction and not believing Nina. Following this, Cassie admits that she only left Amber at a diner where she is ""stupid"" enough to believe the boy band will be, and Cassie leaves. Cassie forgets to meet Ryan for a date, disappointing him. That night, Cassie lures another man into taking her home man. Whilst leaving, Ryan catches them, who is hurt over being stood up, and leaves. Cassie's next target is a former lawyer, Jordan Greene (Alfred Molina), who harassed Nina into dropping her charges. Greene is remorseful, having had a nervous breakdown over his guilt, and Cassie forgives him. After visiting Nina's mother (Molly Shannon), who urges her to move on, Cassie abandons her revenge plans. She apologises to Ryan and they fall in love. Madison confronts Cassie outside her house, desperate to know what happened after their lunch. Cassie reassures her that nothing happened. Madison gives her an old phone containing a video of Nina's rape that she kept before warning her to never contact her again. Watching it, Cassie is shocked and devastated to see Ryan among the rapists. She confronts him and threatens to release the video unless he tells her where Al's bachelor party is being held. Ryan tells her and insists she forgive him, but Cassie refuses. Cassie arrives at Al's bachelor party posing as a stripper, dressed as a sexy nurse with a colourful wig, spikes the drinks of all Al's friends, and takes Al upstairs. Assuming she is giving him a private dance, and accepting her reason for putting on handcuffs, he is cuffed to the bed. Once cuffed, Cassie reveals her identity, showing Al the rap video, and demanding that he apologise. Terrified, seeing she has a knife, he tearfully apologises and insists it was a long time ago. As she starts carving ""Nina"" onto Al's chest, he manages to break free and fatally suffocates Cassie with a pillow. The next morning, Al's friend Joe (Max Greenfield) finds him with Cassie, he realises that she is dead and consoles Al when he explains what happened. Joe convinces Al that no-one knows that she was at the shack, and they drag Cassie's body to burn it in a makeshift furnace. Her parents file a missing person report, and the police begin to investigate. Ryan tells them Cassie was mentally disturbed and does not tell them where she was going. The wedding takes place, with Ryan in attendance. During the ceremony, Ryan receives several scheduled texts from Cassie. At the same time, Greene receives a package from Cassie with a video of Nina's rape and instructions to give it to the police in the event of her disappearance. Also, Gail finds a half heart-shaped necklace with Cassie's name under the cash register; Cassie was wearing the matching necklace with Nina's name on it when she was killed. The police discover her burnt remains and the necklace, and arrest Al at his wedding for the murder. Cassie's final message to Ryan reads ""Enjoy the wedding. Love Cassie and Nina."" Also starring Adam Brody as Jerry, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Neil, Sam Richardson as Paul, and Ray Nicholson as Jim. Mulligan gives a brilliant performance as the young woman flitting between sweet and spiky and often being wildly persuasive and then unnervingly threatening to the characters that deserve punishment. This film has a superbly acid-tongued script, that makes important points about why claims of rape should be taken seriously, the lead character is both fascinating and at times scary, but we always remember her pain and reasons for what she is doing. You are gripped throughout as to which direction it will go, it is darkly funny when it can be, the ending is shocking but equally smart, and the pop music soundtrack (including an orchestral version of Britney Spears's ""Toxic"") makes for good listening, it is a great stylish take on the revenge movie, a clever black comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Emerald Fennell, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing, Original Score for Anthony Willis, and Best Casting, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"
"It's been an awfully long time since I've seen the original ""Candyman"" film, long enough that I might as well have come to this sequel/reboot having never seen it. So on it's own merit, I'm happy to say that I loved it. It had some truly memorable moments and a sad, socially conscious, plot, without ever feeling weighted down by it.Having moved to the now gentrified area of Cabrini in Chicago, Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is struggling to find the muse for his art. He heads to the last remaining area of what was the Projects, and meets William Burke (Colman Domingo) who tells him a story from his childhood about an innocent man who was murdered by the police, but who haunts the city, killing anyone brave or foolish enough to say his name five times into a mirror. Using the story as inspiration, McCoy creates an installation for his girlfriend, Brianna Carthwright's (Teyonah Parris) gallery, one that dares people to call on the urban legend.If I can get the one criticism out of the way early, I don't think that the film is particularly scary. There are some unsettling moments, there are some gory moments, but if you come to this, which is ostensibly a horror film, looking for terror, I don't think it's going to get you there.What it is, is beautifully realised. From the reversed studio logos, all the way through to the amazing end credits it's a great film to look at. It's most memorable moment, for me, was the death of an art critic, which was wonderfully shot. I like the way the film tied back into the original story, but also opened up the mythology of the Candyman character a bit.I'll accept the criticism that the ending is abrupt, but I'm not sure how else the film could have concluded and I really thought overall the film was one of the best of the year so far."
"Candyman dragged its hook to the bitter end, a very slow movie with a decided lack of slasher action. This read as more of an artisanal horror movie rather than a true killer horror film. The acting was decent and the effects worked, but too darn slow and not enough scares."
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1977, in the projects of Cabrini Green, Sherman Fields (Michael Hargrove), a local man with a hook for a hand, becomes known as the 'Candyman' because of his fondness for handing out sweets to local kids. However, when some of the sweets are found to contain poison, he finds himself battered to death by the police when they close in on him. Forty two years later, Anthony McCoy (Yalha Abdul-Mateen), an artist, looking for inspiration, crosses paths with William (Colman Domingo), a local man who fills him in on the legend of the Candyman. After a bee sting, Anthony is plunged in to the legend and toward his destiny when a series of murders start.It's a depressing feeling, when you start to realise how old you're getting when remakes of films are coming out and you can remember the (however vaguely) when the original came out. And so Nia Da Costa's update of the original Candyman arrives (which has made her the most successful female director of all time, or something.) With the social justice trends that have spread around the world after events such as the George Floyd killing, it's certainly a very timely and relevant piece, eager to shine a light on current topics, such as police brutality towards the black community and broader issues in wider society.Da Costa obviously has a deep affection and love of the original film, from her depiction of a modern, gentrified Cabrini Green as opposed to the deprivation in the '92 version, through to the inclusion of original cast member Vanessa Williams in the revelatory scene of the story, as well as references to Helen Lyle from the original film when recounting the CM folklore. Although not the central crux of the story, she is careful to include the original 1800's source of the Candyman legend, and while it doesn't fit in altogether neatly with the core story, it's presence definitely elevates it.The story doesn't come altogether all as well as the original did, and it's a lot more sensitive and restrained with the blood and gore (resulting in a 15 certificate of all things!) But it's still that rare of things, an inspired remake, with some relevant social commentary to make. It's made by a director with a love and affection of the original, rather than a cheap cash in, and that can only be a good thing. ***"
"Delivered out of Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw Production company, with the new king of horror with a message also producing and co-writing this sequel to the 1992 cult film of the same name, Candyman is as high of a quality production as you'd expect from the studio responsible for recent genre hits Get Out and Us but while there's a lot to like about director Nia DaCosta's update of the hooked killer, this version of Candyman lacks a certain special magic and scares holding it back from the film you could tell it wanted desperately to be.Clocking in at a brisk feeling 90 minutes, there's not a lot of room to breathe here in DaCosta's affair with a rare problem for modern day films evident here with a sense that Candyman may've benefited greatly from having 15 - 20 minutes of extra time to explore its many varied angles on current affairs, racial injustices and how we view art, with this element never more evident than in the films final stretch that while having some great scenes, is rushed and too quickfire to make what has come before it truly worth our time.Centered around Watchman breakout star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's struggling Chicago artist Anthony McCoy and his worrying new obsession (and bee sting that is in urgent need of some medical attention) with the legend of the Candyman killer that stalked the neighborhood's of his hometown, an obsession that leads to some extremely grisly and well-staged murders that should appease the gore hounds checking DaCosta's film out, Candyman has an eerie and almost otherworldly vibe running through its veins, enhanced thanks to some stunning cinematography work by DOP John Guleserian and score by Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe but all its great elements don't combine in the way you would hope as we head towards the rushed end game.For someone with such a smart filmmaking brain, you wonder how much say Jordan Peele ended up having in DaCosta's film? As there's a lot of unanswered questions, questionable character decisions and forced feeling undertones in Candyman's being and one wonders if the film would've been better served just aiming for a fun and over the top slasher with a glossy Hollywood sheen rather than one trying to cover a number of bases when it's at its best delivering imaginative carnage and inventive ends for anyone game enough to ""say his name"".Far from a complete failure, Candyman is nevertheless frustrating in its inability to maximize the opportunity it had at its (hook?) fingertips, as it concludes being a decent genre entry that is unlikely to be held in the same regard as its cult original.Final Say -Some brilliant moments and quality production ensures Candyman is a cut above most Hollywood horror efforts but one can't help but feel as though this modern day take on the Candyman brand could've been something far more special had it allowed itself a little more time and space for refinement and growth.3 infected bee stings out of 5."

"Kate: There have been a few female assassin moves lately, Ava, Anna, now we have Kate. Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is an an experienced assassin who is manipulated by her mentor/handler Varrick (Woody Harrelson) into doing one last job, another common theme, as is the requirement for the assassin to be extremely attractive. Kate enters a world of smoke and mirrors when she is poisoned, trying to track down the person behind it in the 24 hours she has left to live. Tension is maintained throughout the film with some good fight scenes and the all seeing eye of surveillance tech. Betrayals, temporary alliances abound as the narrative progresses. Nothing really new here but it's a competent assassin thriller. Directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan from a screenplay by Umair Aleem. On Netflix. 7/10."
"Well shot, some good fight and action scenes, solid acting, and a fine performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Why no higher rating? Simple, the story is predictable, generic and sometimes even tiresome (scenes with dialogue), all ideas are known and borrowed from other movies. Also the running time is in my view too long, the longer the movie run the more I felt rather bored. What else we can deduce from Kate? The universe needs a new species of writers, pronto please."
"This review is sponsored by: Boom Boom Lemon.Ytho did we need another sub-par female assassin movie? If J. Law couldn't pull off a huge production as Red Sparrow, ytho would anyone think Mary Elizabeth Winstead, a B actress I've never heard of, be able to pull it off. The closest no-name actress that ever impressed me in this genre was Sasha Luss in Anna. She was very convincing and played the part well. Of recent, a know action star Maggie Q played the part well in The Protege, which came out last month. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Winstead is a great actress, and she performed very well in this film, but I wasn't sold on her skills and being a kick-butt assassin. So ytho was she cast, when I feel there were many more convincing and experienced female lead options that at least have an action/martial arts background?For me, the standout performance was the lovely and talented newb actress Miku Patricia Martineau, of which this was her first film appearance, with only a bunch of prior TV shows on her resume. She stole the show imo. And Woody Harrelson was as always amazing, but hardly had much screen time.Then there's the name of this film; Kate. Ytho? That is such a simpleton, uninviting and boring title, I would've liked to see some imagination and effort, instead of picking a name out of a hat. Or at least cast Kate Beckinsale, who I kept associating and hoping the female lead would be.And ytho all the ridiculous Japanese eye candy? It deterred from the drama. Ytho the lame Boom Boom Lemon obsession? It wasn't funny, it became annoying.This was newb writer Umair Aleem's 2nd writing credit, but ytho was it every cliche ever played out for this genre? One could even say most of his story was plagiarized from a bunch of films many reviewers already named. Having some plot and technical issues didn't help either. On the plus side, directing by newb Cedric Nicolas-Troyan was fairly decent.The score was surprisingly fitting and not overbearing like in most B films. The pacing was decent, but the 106 min runtime felt a little long with some dragged out and unnecessary scenes.Overall it's an ok film if you enjoy this genre, have nothing better to watch, and don't expect anything revolutionary in the writing, and may even say a few ytho's as you watch the film. It's a 6/10 from me."

The pacing was decent, but the 106 min runtime felt a little long with some dragged out and unnecessary scenes.Overall it's an ok film if you enjoy this genre, have nothing better to watch, and don't expect anything revolutionary in the writing, and may even say a few ytho's as you watch the film. It's a 6/10 from me."
Mary Elizabeth Winstead is totally badass she is a perfect treat and thrilling to see what she does/wears! This is one of ht best movies to be put on Netflix I absolutely love the ridiculous amount of people Kate kills; it's one of the greatest things ever seeing her expressions and the madness that flows. I'm quite happy that IMDb has the rating at 6.3 that pretty good! The cinematography/colors are exceptional I really like the way they made the film.
"Maybe I'm missing something, but for all the hype this film has gained I expected a little more than what I saw."

"It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.Found myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.Wouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.However, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.It is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.Moreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.Overall, very, very good. 8/10"
"KNIVES OUT is another comedy blockbuster based on the classic 'old dark house' style murder mystery plot that was once popular in the 1930s. The last time we had a wave of such movies was in the '80s, when the likes of CLUE was doing the rounds. This is a fairly amiable and enjoyable example of the genre, graced with a large ensemble cast each striving to out-perform one another, a fast pace and never a slow moment. Inevitably the plot itself feels quite artificial at times and stretches credulity on more than one occasion, but at least there are enough likeable or amusing characters and enough genuine surprises to keep you involved in what's going on. As for Daniel Craig, I have a suspicion that this is an easy kind of performance in a role that could be played by any actor, but he's funny enough in the part."
"We all love a good whodunit, the most famous sleuths like Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple deducing a murderer from an A-list cast of suspects, well, now comes this modern day movie in the same league, written and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick Lane, Looper, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Last Jedi). Basically, wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is celebrating his 85th birthday and invites his family to his mansion for his party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds him dead, apparently having slit his own throat. An anonymous figure hires private detective Benoit Blanc (Golden Globe nominated Daniel Craig) to investigate. Blanc learns that Harlan had alienated many of the family: he had threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson) for having an affair; cut off the allowance of his daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette) for stealing money, meant for the tuition for his granddaughter Megan ""Meg"" (Katherine Langford); fired his youngest son Walter ""Walt"" (Michael Shannon) from his publishing company; and cut his lazy grandson Ransom (Chris Evans) out of his will. Flashbacks reveal that after the party Harlan's nurse Marta Cabrera (Golden Globe nominated Ana de Armas) accidentally injected Harlan with a fatal dose of morphine. Minutes from death, Harlan told Marta how to avoid suspicion, making it appear he was still alive after she had driven home, then he slit his own throat. Because Marta cannot lie without vomiting, she avoids answering the questions of Detective Lieutenant Elliot (LaKeith Stanfield), but Blanc asks her to assist in his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence, but is only partially successful. The family, including Harlan's eldest daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), is shocked to hear from Harlan's lawyer Alan Stevens (Frank Oz) that Harlan left everything to Marta. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom tricks Marta into confessing to him but offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys realize that, under the slayer rule, Marta will lose the inheritance if she killed Harlan, but Blanc tells them that they all are still suspects. They try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance. Marta receives a blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc spots her and Ransom, the police catch and arrest Random, while Blanc tells Marta that Wanetta ""Great Nana"" Thrombey (K Callan), Harlan's mother, saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's upstairs rooms on the night of his death. Marta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged. Marta confesses everything to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds Fran had the copy of the full toxicology report. Marta is about to confess everything to the family, but Blanc stops after finding something missing in the report. He brings Marta, Ransom and the police to a room to reveal his deductions. Ransom learned that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, so he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials so she would kill Harlan with an overdose, so she would not gain the inheritance. However, Marta, an experienced nurse, administered the correct medicine without reading the labels. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later witnesses Ransom swapping the vials back and sent him the blackmail note. Realising that Marta had given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom passed on the blackmail note to Marta, removing the address and time. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy the evidence of Marta's innocence and burned Fran's copy of the toxicology report. He drugged Fran with morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder. Marta receives a call from the hospital and says that Fran is alive. Believing that Fran will implicate him, Ransom angrily confesses, and vows revenge. Marta vomits on Ransom; she lied that Fran had survived, and tricked Ransom into confessing. In anger, he grabs a knife from the wall to attack and kill her, but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. Ransom is taken into custody, while Marta watches him and the Thrombey family members from the balcony of what is now her mansion. Also starring Jaeden Martell as Jacob Thrombey, Noah Segan as Trooper Wagner, Riki Lindhome as Donna Thrombey, M. Emmet Walsh as Mr. Proofroc, Marlene Forte as Mrs. Cabrera and Shyrley Rodriguez as Alicia Cabrera, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a voice cameo as Detective Hardrock. Craig is likeably comical as the detective from the Deep South (he sounds like Foghorn Leghorn lol), and other cast members like Curtis, Collette and Armas look like they are having a blast, Evans get some of the best lines throwing insults. The whodunit is a well-trodden genre, but with the addition of a witty script and some deadpan humour along the way, this is a terrific refreshing take on it, I admit you have to really concentrate to get the concluding twist, but I'd like to see a follow-up, overall an entertaining murder mystery. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Rian Johnson, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"
"Despite a few duds--Richard Jewell & The Mule--of late, the aura of Clint Eastwood (especially now as a nonagenarian!) is still enough to get me into the theater to see his works. Unfortunately, while Cry Macho isn't abjectly bad, it is far from great--or even good, really--due to its caricature approach to character, setting, and themes.For a very basic overview, Cry Macho tells the story of Mike Milo (Eastwood), an age-appropriate ranch hand sent to Mexico to retrieve the estranged teenaged son (Eduardo Minett) of ranch owner Howard Polk (Dwight Yoakam). En route, Mike and the boy both learn a little about each other from their romp through Mexico.The good news about Cry Macho? It isn't Eastwood wagging his finger at the younger generation (like in The Mule) or wearing his politics on his sleeve. No, here things are played pretty straight down the middle. Just seeing a 91-year old individual act is in part admirable, and there are a few solid cinematic shots or moments along the way.The easily-identifiable problem in Cry Macho, however, is that nearly every character or scene is a caricature of the real thing. In other words, every interesting nugget is given no more than lip service and never really shown or developed in any meaningful way.A few examples include:-The father/son relationship the whole premise is building towards? Absolutely no payoff whatsoever.-The son in question? Touted as a ""rough kid"", but once met is little more than flip-flopping between comically recalcitrant or moony-eyed over Mike's exploits.-The portrayal of Mexico? As overly simplified as it can get.Even Eastwood himself is essentially playing a caricature mashup, if you will, of performances both young and more recent. Truth be told, he is almost certainly too old to add anything to the part, yet his essence puts the film's onus squarely on his shoulders--which no longer are broad enough, metaphorically-speaking, to handle such a load. As much as I hate to say it, there is not one thing he does here--whether punching out men a quarter of his age, romancing a Mexican widow, or just going on the expedition in the first place, come to think of it--that is even remotely believable without taking into account his previous exploits and sort of transposing them over the plot.In essence, Cry Macho largely consists of Eastwood doling out little pearls of wisdom (or humor) both reluctantly and through gritted teeth or with his traditional sneer. A little bit of everything is covered (family, legacy, aging, religion, love, etc.), but none of it adds up to anything in the end.Like I said, Cry Macho is better than, say, The Mule simply because it tones down the harshness of the generational rhetoric quite a bit. It feels less like a lecture and more like a leisurely siesta, albeit one completely at odds with the thematic material. While not a fun or notable watch in any sense, it does just enough to keep itself from being truly terrible,."
"It was hard to see Clint in this film I understand hes 91 but hes never looked or ACTED like hes over 90. His dialogue was soft and sometimes shaky and just not clint Eastwood I'm just erasing that he made this film and realizing every actor has at least 1 dud. This was just bad, the whole cast was mediocre at best dwight is actually a phenomenal actor given the right role and film this wasn't it, no one plays a better butthead than him watch sling blade!! Anyway watch mule or unforgiven let this 1 pass you by!! Man that was depressing and extremely hard to watch!!!"
"Most Hollywood superstars aren't around long enough to topline as well as produce and direct their own films after celebrating their 90th birthday. Indisputably, Clint Eastwood is the exception. The ""Rawhide"" TV star filmed ""Cry Macho"" during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with New Mexico standing in for Mexico. Not surprisingly, ""Cry Macho"" may contain Clint's final words on the subject of machismo. At one point, Clint's character complains, ""This macho thing is overrated. Just people trying to show that they've got grit. That's about all they end up with. It's like anything else in life: you think you got all the answers, then you realize, as you get older, you don't have any of them."" Front and center most of the time, Clint displays considerable physical agility for what this role demanded of the 90-year-old star. When he isn't cruising in vintage automobiles, he sits tall in the saddle and reminds us he punched Hollywood steers for eight seasons on CBS-TV's ""Rawhide"" from 1959 to 1966. He still makes a cowboy hat look good above his wizened scowl. Violence is held to a minimum in this laid-back, neo-western, but Eastwood also orchestrates it in ways you would least imagine. For the record, he does sucker punch one bad guy. However, he doesn't shoot anybody in the eye. At the same time, Clint corralled Albert S. Ruddy as a co-producer. A seasoned Hollywood veteran, Ruddy produced both versions of ""The Longest Yard"" (1974 & 2005) with Burt Reynolds as well as ""The Cannonball Run"" (1981), and Clint's Oscar-winning girl-fight epic ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004). Ruddy's claim either to fame or infamy is as producer of ""The Godfather"" trilogy (1972, 1974, & 1990). Meantime, Clint doesn't cut himself any slack in this 104-minute, PG-rated, picaresque yarn about a broken-down rodeo rider who crosses the border to find his boss man's son and bring him home. Indeed, this constitutes a journey of hardship with our hero escorting an unruly teen and his game fighting rooster. Comparisons between the recent Liam Neeson road trip ""The Marksman"" are inevitable, but ""Cry Macho"" stands its own ground and engenders greater feelings of optimism at fadeout.""Cry Macho"" takes place between the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Michael Milo (Clint Eastwood of ""Unforgiven"") is a washed-up rodeo champ who has weathered his share of hard times. Not only did he break his back when a horse threw him at a rodeo, but he also lost his wife and son in a tragic auto accident. He squandered everything in his abysmal grief and relied on the charity of his few and far-between friends. Now, his friend and former boss Howard Polk (Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade"") asks him to drive down to Mexico City and return with his 13-year-old son, Rafael (newcomer Eduardo Minett), so the latter can live with him on his sprawling ranch. Shifty-eyed Howard doesn't tell Milo that he dispatched two younger guys earlier to do the job. Neither made it back. First thing Milo does after he agrees reluctantly to embark on this odyssey is head straight to Mexico City in a late-model Chevy truck to see Howard's tempestuous ex-wife. Neither Howard nor Leta can stand the sight of each other, and Howard fears he would be incarcerated if he sets foot across the border. Turns out Rafael spends more time on the streets than he does with Leta in her palatial estate where the parties never cease. Leta (Fernanda Urrejola of ""Bring Me The Head of the Machine Gun Woman"") suspects Rafael frequents underground cock-fighting arenas. She sends two of her bodyguards to shadow Milo, but he eludes them. Milo ambles into one cock-fighting arena moments before the dreaded Federale Police raid it. Barely escaping arrest himself, Milo lucks up and finds Rafael hiding nearby with his fighting cock rooster named Macho. Milo is surprised when Rafael is eager to accompany him back to Texas. What neither realizes is they will become the object of a widespread manhunt because not only Leta but also the Federales want them. When they aren't dodging Leta's henchmen and the police, our heroes tangle with car thieves. The road back to Texas is no picnic. They encounter obstacles from the get-go and things grow even more complicated before Milo turns Rafael over to Howard. Ironically, the most surprising thing for Milo is his snake-bitten luck changes drastically when Rafael and he encounter a wise widow and her brood of motherless grandchildren.""Cry Macho"" benefits tremendously from British cinematographer Ben Davis's virtuoso lensing. Davis shot both ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) and ""Captain Marvel"" (2019). He makes the Mexican landscape look spectacular but forbidding. Moments arise when you can forget about the plot and savor the sentiments of the moment. For example, Milo races past a pasture and watches as a herd of galloping quarter horses gallop alongside him. ""Grand Torino"" scenarist Nick Schenk adapted N. Richard Nash's novel ""Cry Macho"" for Eastwood. The novel is far bleaker than the film. Just to show you the tortured trajectory some literary properties endure, Nash wrote his book as a screenplay initially, but 20th Century Fox turned it down in the 1970s. Later, he converted it into a novel. ""Jaws"" star Roy Scheider tried to make it in 1991, but the project lacked momentum. Similarly, Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted it as his comeback picture in 2011 after he finished his term as California's governor. Eastwood himself had a crack at it in 1988 but wound up making ""The Dead Pool"" (1988), the fifth ""Dirty Harry"" feature film. Earlier, Eastwood had expressed interest in helming it with actor Robert Mitchum who had starred in the neo-western rodeo epic ""The Lusty Men"" (1952). Whether Eastwood keeps on starring in his own movies or not remains to be seen. All in all, the predictable but entertaining ""Cry Macho"" captures the venerable spirit of those Saturday Evening Post magazine covers painted by Norman Rockwell about American culture in the 1930s."
"WOW. False advertising, indeed.The trailers tell you all you need to know about the simple plot, but mislead you for the meaning. Of which, there is none. Just that simple plot remains.Okay, you could say it ""has lessons,"" but they're forced, like everything else in this A-B-C, clichéd movie. The most miraculous part of this was that Clint Eastwood directed, produced and starred in this at 90+ years old. That was part of the draw for me.I recently watched another 90+ star, Harry Dean Stanton, in the masterful, wonderful ""Lucky."" Stanton gave a solid performance in a near-perfect film. It was his send-off, love letter to the movies, a lifetime career and his fans. I hoped the same for ""Cry Macho."" And that was a big, fat NOPE.The other part I was looking forward to was the part in the trailer which suggested Eastwood played against type, his old ""macho"" ways in cowboy movies and, of course, ""Dirty Harry."" This is also mostly untrue. Just like the few seconds in the trailer that suggests that, you'll get just as much in this movie. And that was a disappointment.It would be nice for him to show, don't tell the cost of being so shallow. Being macho is silly, sad, trite and makes the person look like a neanderthal, like we never evolved. So, don't go into this movie expecting Eastwood to finally teach against type.Instead expect a very simple story of Texan wants his son back from his ex-wife in Mexico and hires Eastwood to go South of the border, literally kidnap him and take him back to the states. Along the way, they encounter all the stereotypical things ""gringos"" would encounter in Mexico (I definitely know that,) but also many, many, many outlandish opportunities and coincidences.Since Eastwood's 90+ when he made this, everything was practically handed to him to make him look like the tough cowboy he once was. Normally, that wouldn't ever work with him being so old, slow and fragile. Ever hear about people pulling punches? They literally do that for every conflict he's in. Everything is so easy for him and you know he didn't perform 90% of what he showed his character do in this movie. Hell, once he was making a chicken dinner and another time training a horse and I didn't even buy either scene, especially since they were so comically edited around him doing them.I will give the movie credit for being well shot and it was extremely funny at times. But the movie and characters were so bland, so by the numbers and predictable, I literally did doze off a few times. Admittedly, I've only seen a portion of his movies, and this definitely ranks near the bottom, sadly.***Final Thoughts: Normally, I try not to watch trailers, but I did catch this a few times in theatres. Boy that was a helluva more promising and interesting than the whole movie. And yes, I really did want a blossoming story of Eastwood attempting to teach the boy he kidnaps that being macho is NOT the way to go. I really thought this would be Eastwood's masterpiece and a great send off if this is his last film.See why I try not to watch trailers? They either spoil scenes, endings or expectations."
"Clint Eastwood is a name I am a huge fan of. I watched all his movies many times and bought them as DVD, Blu-Ray, Vhs. He's done very well lately. But 'Cry Macho' turned out to be a mediocre movie."

"Wives, imagine celebrating another wedding anniversary with your husband at a swanky restaurant. After you have dined on savory cuisine and sipped elegant wine, he walks behind your chair and drapes an exotic necklace at your throat. Later, he persuades you to don a blindfold because he has a surprise in store. You endure a tiresome drive into the middle of nowhere. The romantic lake house is straight out of Disney's ""Frozen."" Powdery white snow is heaped high everywhere, and the lake is iced over. Eventually, you follow a trail of rose petals lit by flickering candlelight to the upstairs boudoir. Awakening refreshed and contented the next morning, you watch in mute horror as your husband puts a gun to his head, pulls the trigger, and blood-splattered brain particles shower you! Of course, nothing like this would ever happen to you!Nevertheless, the ill-fated wife in this thriller, Emma (Megan Fox of ""Jennifer's Body""), is devastated by her husband's suicide. Freshman director Scott Dale's ""Till Death"" (*** OUT OF ****) qualifies as a nimbly wrought nail-biter that conjures up suspense and intrigue galore throughout its gripping 83-minutes. Scenarist Jason Carvey, who wrote ""A New Wave"" (2006), has penned an atmospheric thriller that confines most of its action to a remote lake house after a brooding opening gambit in New York City. Emma's husband Mark (Eoin Macken of ""Close"") kills himself 23 minutes into ""Till Death"" and traps his woebegone wife in a house where she cannot find anything to remove her shackles. Before he killed himself, Mark admitted their marriage had fallen apart long. He admitted his philandering ways had driven Emma into the arms of another lover. At the same time, Mark had forsaken all sense of morality and steeped himself in corruption enough to prompt authorities to raid and ransack his offices.Mark is a 'piece of work.' Not only does he kill himself without a qualm, but he also leaves his unfaithful wife in a tight spot. The night they dined out, Emma had told her lover, one of Mark's colleagues, Tom Gorman (Aml Ameen of ""Red Tails""), that she could no longer continue an affair behind Mark's back.Ironically, Mark qualifies as the ""ball and chain"" in their flawed marriage. Typically, this term applies to females. Here, the act of Emma dragging Mark everywhere gives new meaning to this phrase. Moreover, when she awoke, Emma had on a skimpy satin negligée, and the loss of heat in the lake house has put a chill in her marrow. Towing Mark's corpse around the house like a mule takes a toll on Emma. Her bruised wrist aches from the pain of her exertions. Later, she sprawls Mark on her wedding gown and finds it easier to haul him around the premises.Dale and Carvey have done an admirable job of painting our heroine into a corner. She is secluded in the middle of nowhere. Emma drags Mark's body outside and into the garage. She spots a hose sticking out of their SUV gas tank where Mark had drained off the gas! Earlier, she had struggled to use a soaked cell phone she found submerged in a flower vase. Mark's revolver held only one bullet, so she cannot obliterate the handcuffs. She curses Mark for the dastard that he is and this dire turn of events has her stymied. She is surprised when her former lover Tom shows up at the front door. Tom talks about the authorities ransacking Mark's office. Tom is stunned when he looks Mark's corpse on the wedding dress. While they are talking, an unknown vehicle wheels up in the driveway. Tom and Emma exchange suspicious glances.If Emma thought she was stuck between a rock and a hard place, she is alarmed by what happens next. Before they dined out, she spotted a dossier on Mark's desk about a low-life hoodlum, Bobby Ray (Callan Mulvey of ""Shadow in the Cloud""), who had stabbed her in a street robbery years ago. Ray landed in prison for ten years. This happened before Emma, an amateur photographer, married Mark. Since he is no longer incarcerated, Bobby Ray has a score to settle with Emma. Mark has promised him $200 thousand in diamonds. Moreover, it also turns out this ex-convict gutted Tom fatally when he tried to run them off. Emma relies on her wits to elude Bobby Ray and his timid, safe-cracking brother, Jimmy (Jack Roth of ""Brimstone""), and director Scott Dale stages a tense game of cat & mouse.Of course, Megan Fox is no Meryl Streep. Nevertheless, the ""Transformers"" actress has gotten older, and Emma is no idiot. Happily, she is an ordinary, down-to-earth, but troubled wife. She lacks the knack to unlock her shackles. Later, Emma musters unheard of ferocity when she clobbers Bobby Ray with a golf club and then locks Jimmy up. The dreadful predicament of our heroine inclines you to feel more sympathetic to her plight. Fox doesn't let her tantrums get out of hand during her moments of hysteria. Now, she faces a fate worse than death from wicked Bobby Ray. Callan Mulvey steals the last half-hour of ""Till Death"" with his electrifying performance as a pugnacious ruffian who wields a knife like a butcher. Ultimately, the villains catch Emma and stab her. Television lenser Jamie Cairney captures the action from a variety of angles. Although the setting is upstate New York, the producers filmed ""Till Death"" on location in Bulgaria. Altogether, this occasionally exasperating, often white-knuckled exercise in suspense will keep you on edge."
"Till Death doesn't come close to achieving the psychological payoffs of a Gerald's Game but what it holds good on is offering Megan Fox (once stereotyped in generic ""hot girl"" roles) something worthwhile. The horror here is only in the form of blood-spill, so let's get that out of the way. The entirety of the first act feels like an exercise in blandness - every actor including Fox simply goes through the motions without making us feel strongly for their respective characters. We have the by-now-clichéd terrible husband (Eoin Macken), the wife (Fox) and her boyfriend (Aml Ameen), and finally, an ex-convict (Callan Mulvey) with a grudge. It only gets interesting around the 25-minute mark, however, even the second act is just Fox bumping around the house and its surrounding icy landscape with a corpse handcuffed to her.The third act thankfully features a few well-packaged, sufficiently gory thrills. When Fox gets into action-hero mode, she elevates the film to a fair extent. On the flip side, the climax plays out exactly the way you expect it to. It isn't a difficult film to sit through at all - to its advantage, the better parts arrive towards its grisly finale. Jason Carvey's writing is both clever and lacklustre at the same time: the deceptive cat-and-mouse bits intrigue while the overall predictability cannot be ignored. If nothing else, this is a perfectly serviceable comeback vehicle for Fox."

Of course, nothing like this would ever happen to you!Nevertheless, the ill-fated wife in this thriller, Emma (Megan Fox of ""Jennifer's Body""), is devastated by her husband's suicide. Freshman director Scott Dale's ""Till Death"" (*** OUT OF ****) qualifies as a nimbly wrought nail-biter that conjures up suspense and intrigue galore throughout its gripping 83-minutes. Scenarist Jason Carvey, who wrote ""A New Wave"" (2006), has penned an atmospheric thriller that confines most of its action to a remote lake house after a brooding opening gambit in New York City. Emma's husband Mark (Eoin Macken of ""Close"") kills himself 23 minutes into ""Till Death"" and traps his woebegone wife in a house where she cannot find anything to remove her shackles. Before he killed himself, Mark admitted their marriage had fallen apart long. He admitted his philandering ways had driven Emma into the arms of another lover. At the same time, Mark had forsaken all sense of morality and steeped himself in corruption enough to prompt authorities to raid and ransack his offices.Mark is a 'piece of work.' Not only does he kill himself without a qualm, but he also leaves his unfaithful wife in a tight spot. The night they dined out, Emma had told her lover, one of Mark's colleagues, Tom Gorman (Aml Ameen of ""Red Tails""), that she could no longer continue an affair behind Mark's back.Ironically, Mark qualifies as the ""ball and chain"" in their flawed marriage. Typically, this term applies to females. Here, the act of Emma dragging Mark everywhere gives new meaning to this phrase. Moreover, when she awoke, Emma had on a skimpy satin negligée, and the loss of heat in the lake house has put a chill in her marrow. Towing Mark's corpse around the house like a mule takes a toll on Emma. Her bruised wrist aches from the pain of her exertions. Later, she sprawls Mark on her wedding gown and finds it easier to haul him around the premises.Dale and Carvey have done an admirable job of painting our heroine into a corner. She is secluded in the middle of nowhere. Emma drags Mark's body outside and into the garage. She spots a hose sticking out of their SUV gas tank where Mark had drained off the gas! Earlier, she had struggled to use a soaked cell phone she found submerged in a flower vase. Mark's revolver held only one bullet, so she cannot obliterate the handcuffs. She curses Mark for the dastard that he is and this dire turn of events has her stymied. She is surprised when her former lover Tom shows up at the front door. Tom talks about the authorities ransacking Mark's office. Tom is stunned when he looks Mark's corpse on the wedding dress. While they are talking, an unknown vehicle wheels up in the driveway. Tom and Emma exchange suspicious glances.If Emma thought she was stuck between a rock and a hard place, she is alarmed by what happens next. Before they dined out, she spotted a dossier on Mark's desk about a low-life hoodlum, Bobby Ray (Callan Mulvey of ""Shadow in the Cloud""), who had stabbed her in a street robbery years ago. Ray landed in prison for ten years. This happened before Emma, an amateur photographer, married Mark. Since he is no longer incarcerated, Bobby Ray has a score to settle with Emma. Mark has promised him $200 thousand in diamonds. Moreover, it also turns out this ex-convict gutted Tom fatally when he tried to run them off. Emma relies on her wits to elude Bobby Ray and his timid, safe-cracking brother, Jimmy (Jack Roth of ""Brimstone""), and director Scott Dale stages a tense game of cat & mouse.Of course, Megan Fox is no Meryl Streep. Nevertheless, the ""Transformers"" actress has gotten older, and Emma is no idiot. Happily, she is an ordinary, down-to-earth, but troubled wife. She lacks the knack to unlock her shackles. Later, Emma musters unheard of ferocity when she clobbers Bobby Ray with a golf club and then locks Jimmy up. The dreadful predicament of our heroine inclines you to feel more sympathetic to her plight. Fox doesn't let her tantrums get out of hand during her moments of hysteria. Now, she faces a fate worse than death from wicked Bobby Ray. Callan Mulvey steals the last half-hour of ""Till Death"" with his electrifying performance as a pugnacious ruffian who wields a knife like a butcher. Ultimately, the villains catch Emma and stab her. Television lenser Jamie Cairney captures the action from a variety of angles. Although the setting is upstate New York, the producers filmed ""Till Death"" on location in Bulgaria. Altogether, this occasionally exasperating, often white-knuckled exercise in suspense will keep you on edge."
"This was rocking along pretty well, with some sparkling performance from the main cast and intriguing early plot developments. The ending however doesn't work. It goes too far and the end areas energy doesn't connect with the precedent energy and pitch from the earlier remainder of the film. It gets unsophisticated real quick. Though the earlier parts are all very memorable. Thanks for the film."
"Two hours of boring, predictable story telling and annoying acting. This movie had like 5 different endings. It was so stupid and highly unrealistic. Pass."
"Cause it said was new and for free! Yah! So I watched it, and I liked it! And it was sexy and fun! Until it wasn't! Lol but it was very well written and I am trying to watch all of the dudes' stuff , so yeah , I highly recommend it , it felt like some sort of short story or even fairy-tale thing , but here it is in real life sort of and in real time today! Very cool very sexy and alluring and ingenious, loved the way he wrapped it all up at the end , great job, hope to see more from this talented artist!"

"This movie follows the Horror movie trope of casting exceptionally annoying actors to play exceptionally annoying characters, so the audience won't feel sad watching terrible things happen to them. And ""exceptionally annoying actors"" is the kindest way I could ever describe the two leads; cringe, cringe, cringe. There is eventually a payoff in the story which makes all the aggravation worthwhile, if you hate yourself enough to endure it. 😬
One note about many reviewers' claims that the ending is ""preposterous & unbelievable"". The story is a blend of two real-life court cases regarding voyeurism presented as ""art"". The Tate Modern Gallery has a skywalk where visitors are encouraged to look through the windows of a neighboring residence; residents attempted to sue for breach of privacy, to no avail. Another controversial art exhibit consisted solely of very intimate photos taken through telephoto lenses into peoples' homes through slits in their windows. This is not unrealistic; it's much too real. Amazon has an excellent selection of blackout curtains, I dunno if I can plug particular brands here but the best ones are merely 7$ per panel and they will give you a Gorgeous Home, safe from creeping & peeping 👀👁. Worth their weight in gold, I own 4 pairs."
"That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical."
"Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that."
"Bong Joon-ho's ""Gisaengchung"" (""Parasite"" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like ""Joker"", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw ""The Host"". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it."
"A poor South Korean family lives in a ramshackle semi-basement apartment and gets by on hustles and cons. One day the son manages to get a job tutoring the child of a wealthy family. He sees an opportunity to get his parents and sister jobs in the household too. Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball.Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary.It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions.As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending.Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction."
"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future."
"The crew once again comes together and saves the world. They had to create a past and make John Cena the brother of Vin Diesel and the bad guy. Jordana Brewster is back and Helen Mirren in a cameo. No Jason Stratham, but we do get Charlize Theron as the bad girl.The plot is immaterial. There is more car wreckage than what Bruce Willis did to Moscow. Roof top jumping becomes bus/truck top jumping. There is a scene which pokes fun at the FF series by discussing the infinite impossible missions that they go on and they don't die, or even get a scratch.And of course all ends well with the extended family meal.I learned you can drive through a mine field but you must be going 80 MPH or more. If you zig-zag when running away from someone shooting at you with an automatic weapon, you never get hit. Nobody know how to shoot out a tire. The Pontiac Fiero (plot spoiler) is rated for the icy vacuum of outer space. And Yoda was a puppet. Grab the popcorn, leave your mind at the door."

"Well they did sub-title this a ""saga"", but I wasn't quite expecting something this poor. Things didn't auger well when the cinema screen broke down and we were turfed out after thirty minutes. Next week, back for part two - complete with ""an opportunity to refresh our memories"" as the cinema lad put it... Sadly, though, the first half hour provides us with easily the most entertaining elements of this otherwise weak story bereft of just about everything bar some super stunts/visual effects and Charlize Theron locked up in a plastic cage. There is some effort made to create some characters, and Vin Diesel does bring a certain degree of charisma to the screen, but after an initial flurry of decent motor sport action, we drop from a great height into a family revenge/melodrama that has only one, entirely predictable, conclusion. It is a piece of harmless escapism that serves to divert us from reality for an extremely overlong 2 hrs and 20 minutes but this franchise really misses Paul Walker and although I'm sure nobody will listen, this is not much of a testament to his memory and ought to be the last unless someone is going to revamp the concept thoroughly and invest in solid stories and characters to compliment the endless, and increasingly sterile, visuals. I want one of those planes, though...."
"And a dozen other productions, shamelessly. Just like civilization in 2021 -- total chaos."
"5 out of 5 stars.F9 takes the action to a whole new level of ridiculous. Always going big and insane. If your looking for a mindless summer action flick. Definitely the film for you. It is big, loud, and fun.The story is great. Following Dom going after his brother Jakob played by John Cena. Who is a fun addition to see him going head to head with Vin Diesel. The film does give some flashbacks to Dom and Jakob earlier years which was interesting to see. Which helps give that background story to these characters. The film concept does mess with powerful magnets which can cause cars to flip.A lot of characters return which was fun to see. A lot back in action. The cast ensemble is great. Only getting bigger through sequels.The action sequences are over the top and awesome. It can be cheesy. But this film is just trying to entertain which it does it well. Justin Lin direction is great. He can deliver action and lots of car destruction.A great action film and fun addition to the series. Plus a mid credit scene which would be fun to see where they go next."
"Terrific gangster movie about true love, sex and drama. I loved it but don't reccomend for everyone. Graphics sex scenes."
"Seriously it was pretty obvious from the start that this had zero story and was basically a feeble attempt to pass a weak porn flick off into mainstream cinemasTo be honest 50 shades of Grey was a load of 💩 and this no different apart from the lead actor in this in my opinion was a lot better looking and sexier than the guy who played Christian Grey .If you want to watch some free harmless sex scenes then you may enjoy what this flick has to offer ,however if you want to be entertained intellectually then forget it! Almost forgot to mention the very annoying pop music played almost right the way through this but then again they needed something to fill the gaps in lack of script I guess!"
"The movie got quite infamous - I think it was in the top 10 in many countries, because of ... word of mouth. Though mouths are being used for things here, that will be quite appalling to some. You don't even have to be a prude to feel this goes a bit too far. This is quite the understatement to be honest, because it is quite explicit.While I didn't freeze frame, you can clearly see a (plastic) penis in many shots. So if that already is shocking and feels a bit too much ... maybe this isn't for you. The shock value aside though, because while most already have mentioned and are aware of the 50 shades of grey connection, many have not mentioned or connected this with the Beauty and the Beast story. It is there, even the time frame, how long she has to fall in love and all that. There is no witch with a curse, but there is an inciting incident at the beginning of the movie, that completely breaks our character.This broken strong man (alpha male) type thing draws a certain female fantasy and type in. So while I think a lot are unfair to demean this because of its story, the real flaws lie in the script and the very weak performances. As a mixture of two movies this is fine actually. If the script would have had some tweaks to it, I might even have considered it better than 50 shades (you can hate me now), especially because of the B&B injection - and because it actually dares to go some extra miles (didn't even have to be as explicit).So in conclusion, not your typical love story in any stretch of the imagination (and not much imagination needed anyway) ..."
"A ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" kidnapping porn mafia film. Seriously, who watched this film for the story? I have no training in writing yet I'm confident I can write better porn script than this piece of work."

A stranger (Emraan Hashmi) is caught in a snowstorm on his way from a hill station to Delhi & seeks refuge in an isolated bungalow belonging to a Retd. Chief Justice ( Dhritiman Chatterjee). As the night progresses, we are introduced to the other characters, Amitabh Bachchan (Public Procecutor), Annu Kapoor (Defence Council), Raghuvir Yadav, Rhea Chakraborty and Siddhant Kapoor.To kill time, the stranger is invited to a game of a mock trial in which the court proceedings are held exactly per the Indian judicial system. However there is a sinister twist in the tale which forms the crux of the plot.Boasting of a stellar lead cast, Chehre does complete justice to a strong script with power-packed performances by each and every one of them. The film might seem slow to viewers who are used to watching thrillers that provide an instant adrenaline rush. Expect none of this in the film. This film is actually a slow burn with the eerie ambience of the isolated dim lit bungalow & the heavy snowstorm creating a perfect setting for an Agatha Christie like whodunnit.Pls do not go by the negative reviews posted online. This film, although slow, steadily leads you to a conclusion where you won't feel that you have wasted your time. The climax featuring a lengthy monologue by Big B could have been cut short & the runtime of 2hrs 18mins could've been definitely shortened by around 20 mins to make it more slick.I would definitely recommend this film to people interested in strong content oriented cinema.Adios 🙂"
"I know that bunch of people like because they are fans of the actors or from marketing team. But in this case it is opposite because of Rhea, people gave it less rating. This movie is not a 10/10, but it's not 1/10 either. After watching this movie with very detailed focus I give this a 8/10 rating. I think this movie is a nice decent watch. Rhea's acting was little off, but every others acting was brilliant."
"The right to privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of Indian Constitution.With the invocation of privacy as a fundamental right under Section 21 of the Indian constitution, the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence should now be questioned.Cyber crime law states that if an IO confiscates a mobile or laptop, he/she has to check the hash value.Hash value recorded at the time of seizure has to be the same on the device when the gadgets are given back.This ensures the sanctity of data.Otherwise any false evidence aka incriminating evidence can be implanted.The seized gadgets shud be closed in a faraday bag.Coming back to this movie, the public prosecutor played by Amitabh Bachan obtains the mobile phone illegally, while the judge simply sits there n doesnt discourage the improper manners used for obtaining evidence.Even the defending lawyer (Annu Kapoor) doesn't raise any objections.The court should be careful while admitting illegally obtained evidence as by allowing such shreds of evidence, courts are promoting the improper methods of procuring evidence.The exclusionary rule is enshrined in the fourth amendment of the American Constitution.In the United States, the exclusionary rule is a legal rule, based on constitutional law, that prevents evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights from being used in a court of law.Fifth Amendment also states that no person ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.""Coming back to the movie, the snowy landscape looked very fake n even the fire looked fake.The movie has too many plot holes.Generous with a 5 for Bachan n Hashmi sharing screen for the first time."
"EDIT: 3rd September 2021, IMDB ratings of this film stand at 7.2! SSR bots are probably burning somewhere in hell xDDDD!!First of all, i would request IMDB to remove these ssr fans reviews from their site as they are basically baseless ones (such immature stuff happens only in India)... well if you are mature enough you will review the film only after watchingNow coming to the film. The first half is quite tensed and interesting. You already know from the trailer that Emraan must have committed a crime hence all this drama still you would like to know how things proceed and what exactly he did to deserve this fate. Tensed and interesting conversations , thanks to an earnest starcast makes the convos interesting.The 2nd half is where the film becomes ordinary. Emraan's past reminds of his regular cassanova films with betrayal. And that past too is not a good one. Hence the 2nd half is a miss!Amitabh, Emraan, Dhritiman, Anu and Raghubir...these 5 legends make sure that the present part is watchable and interesting! Rhea plays a rather mysterious complex character and she's decent (at the least i would say..ok).Overall, a film that you can give a shot at (if you are not one of those immature ssr nibba-nibbi fan base member). Remember, the 2nd half is a little dissapointing but i think the overall film can be watched for it's performances and an interesting mock court sequence."
"The movie has a great story director and cinematography but it is too much lengthy for court drama movie as always Amitabh sir's, Emraan Hashmis and everyone acted greatly."
"I was really looking forward to this, but what a disappointmentSo, if you are going to do Cinderella you have to stick with the basic game plan. You have a girl who is abused after father dies and the step mother takes over, and the two step sisters are mean also.The ball comes along and Cinderella gets to go because the fairy godmother uses magic to send her in a beautiful gown and in a pumpkin carriage. There is the glass slippers, and the wedding at the end.You can change stuff to a certain extent but when you cross over those boundaries then it stops being Cinderella. This movie takes too many liberties and too much creative license with the story. For example:Cinderella has a step mother that isn't cruel, she's just missed out on her dream as a pianist and it's all because of a male world. (bs)Cinderella doesn't want to marry the prince. Instead she want's to make dresses, and has an opportunity to travel the world with a Queen from another country. (bs)The mice who are turned in to footmen joke about having to take a pee out of their ""front tail"". (totally not needed)There is no pumpkin, just a crate which turns in to a carriage and two horses. (meh)The fairy godmother isn't a godmother. (this is ok, but don't call him a fairy godmother).The prince doesn't want to be king and wants to travel the world with Cinderella, not married, but as love interests. (meh)Instead the Princess wants to be King, is corrected by the mother that she would be Queen. (meh)There are other changes which I did not like, but most of all I thought the movie missed the mark. It was sort of like 'Ella Enchanted and they even had the same Queen songs. It had a good cast, but I blame the director and the writer (all the same persons) for the mistakes.This is not Cinderella. Don't call it as such."
"Because of the talent of the actors I really wanted to like this. However, the closer this got to the end, the more it became evident this movie teaches children modernist, feminist, socio-political me-ism and downgrades marriage as a valid institution. ""Why put a label on it?"" I'll tell you why: because love warrants a firm foundation, not a sloppy ""until I get tired of you"" attitude.I understand they were trying to update the fairy-tale story of Cinderella... but they took that concept too far. I have no problem with the Hispanic Cinderella; the main actress could not have been cuter. The supporting actors were enjoyable in their parts. Until they hit the last half hour or so, I found it enjoyable. Then it just turned stupid.Flash to the writers and directors: You can get married and still accomplish your life's goals. If someone is going to be selfish and pursue their dreams in exclusion to everything else, let them do so alone. Love isn't about selfishness and self-fulfillment; it's about forming a partnership. There's your socio-political statement, but with some common-sense added to it.Currently this movie has a rating of 4, and deserves it. It sends the wrong message to children, twists the original story to the point of being unrecognizable (a WOODEN CRATE instead of a pumpkin? Are they serious? What blockhead came up with that concept? Surely they could have come up with something funnier and more interesting).I did enjoy a lot of the music, but the movie had some of the worst choreography we've seen in some time. If the ""morals"" of this story is what the modern world is about... maybe humanity is due for a major wake-up call. I would not take a child of any age to see this movie. These aren't the kind of morality and ethics I'd wish to teach children... and it's not the director's privilege to try to mold children's minds. One does get tired of having someone's personal agendas shoved down our throats through ""children's movies""."
"It tries so hard to be politically correct and equal, that it forgets the meaning of the story.Some of the worst acting I have ever seen in my life, at times I thought I was watching a spoof, this really does need to be seen to be believed.The people behind this movie wanted to make some sort of statement, that is obvious, but to literally tear up the sweet story of Cinderella, that's just not on, couldn't you have called it something else? What next? I shudder to think.I wanted to like it, but come on this was just cringe worthy.A disaster, 2/10."
"Totally ridiculous, anachronistic, horribly written musical... but the musical talent is spectacular. I wasn't crazy about all the song choices, but the choral harmonies and dance numbers get you out of your seat. And there are two musical moments that make it worth watching the movie, the PERFECT duet at the ball and the look on Camila Cabello's face when Idina Menzel assumes the high melody note in their mini-duet (1:44:18). (It was a pure recognition of the incomparable talent that is Idina Menzel!) The final musical number is pure joy! Those musical moments are straight up 9 (superb) but, alas, I give this movie a 6 (fair) out 10. {Fantasy Musical}"
I had to watch it because I have an 11 year old niece. What is your excuse?
"Yours truly has a day-job in marketing, and I can tell you straightforward that the horror film-industry is nothing but just that: pure marketing trickery! Here we have a director with a good reputation (David Gordon Green; ""Joe"", ""Pineapple Express""), and the respectable lead heroine Jamie Lee Curtis, coming forward with a pretentious promotional campaign stating that their new film is a direct sequel to the almighty 1978 original. So, basically, they are saying this film is superior, while the numerous sequels and reboots of the past 40 years are utterly useless (and that includes the sequels Curtis starred in herself). It might be clever and appealing marketing, but mostly I find it disrespectful to the memory of Donald Pleasance and everyone else who was ever involved in the production of a ""Halloween"" sequel.Moreover, Gordon Green and Lee Curtis can say whatever they want; - in the end the new ""Halloween"" is also just a very prototypical and everyday horror sequel with dumb characters and extremely sadist annihilation. Fine by me, because I'm a slasher-fanatic, but then don't pretend you're better than the rest. And, for the record, I enjoyed every single and supposedly horrendous sequel in the ""Halloween"" series and even appreciated the widely exiled Rob Zombie remake.The most interesting aspect of the film is that lead characters Laurie Strode and Michael Myers are 40 years older, meaning that cute babysitter Laurie is now a grandmother herself and Michael is, at 61, a sort of senior-citizen-serial-killer. That means he should apply for a discount card to travel by bus, rather than always having to kill the driver! Laurie led a miserable life, though, largely driven by fear and paranoia. She's trying to improve her relationships with estranged daughter Karen and granddaughter Allyson, but her isolated life-style and obsession with Michael returning to finish the feud complicate her attempts. When Old Mickey escapes, from a prison transport naturally, it turns out that he still has a fetish for hacking up babysitters. The intensity of the murders and the bloodshed in ""Halloween"" is terrific. They are sick and vile, and David Gordon Green often manages to adequately build up tension and atmosphere prior to the slaughters. The script, however, is very mundane and contains too many cliches and bad twists. Michael Myers is always nearby, and he easily finds his targeted victims, as if he has a build-in GPS system. The 2 podcasters are useless and irritating characters. Besides, since when is making stupid podcasts a good enough reason to be permitted to have access to the most dangerous serial killer of the country? Even more irritating and useless is the character of Myers' doctor Sartain, supposedly Dr. Sam Loomis' successor, for whom the script has an utterly ridiculous and implausible plot twist in store. The film's main message is that absolutely nothing has changed in forty years. Michael Myers is pure evil, like Donald Pleasance has been repeating since his very first murder at age 6."
"Greetings again from the darkness. I believe the term is 'full circle'. It was 1978, and I vividly recall waiting anxiously for the opening night start of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN. Now, 40 years later, I've just watched what is likely (hopefully!) the final entry of a franchise that spans between 9 and 12 movies, depending on which ones you count (although, apparently we are only supposed to count the first one and this latest). Carpenter's original film gave us the backstory of 6 year old Michael Myers killing his sister Judith in 1963, and subsequently being confined to a sanitarium before showing up on All Hallows Eve in 1978 for what is now referred to as The Babysitter Murders.Writer/director David Gordon Green (STRONGER, 2017) and co-writers Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley make it clear from the start that this is a direct sequel (ignore the others!) to the 1978 original, although having a sequel and its original share the same title is itself a bit confusing. For anyone unfamiliar with Carpenter's original classic (the one that kicked off an entire genre of slasher films), the filmmakers offer up a couple of fame-seeking British podcasters (Rhian Rees, Jefferson Hall) to spell out the history and gory details of Michael Myers and Haddonfield, Illinois. Michael has been institutionalized for four decades, never uttering a single word to his doctors ... neither the now-deceased Dr. Loomis nor his protégé Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer mimicking some of Donald Pleasance's oratory style). Thanks to a not-unexpected bus wreck, and the amateurish prank of the podcasters, Michael Myers is reunited with his William Shatner mask (looking a bit rough these days) and sets off to kill innocents and track down his nemesis, Laurie Strode.The challenges of filmmakers in 2018 versus those in 1978 aren't just limited to disposing of podcasters and teenager's cell phones. They must also be cautious about treating women as victims, and here Laurie Strode is anything but. She has spent these years preparing herself and training her now-grown daughter Karen (Judy Greer) what to do once (not if) Michael Myers returns. Mother and daughter are now somewhat estranged, connected mostly by Laurie's granddaughter Allyson (newcomer Andi Matichak). It's kind of clever how the filmmakers empower the three generations so that together they may face off against the evil that has haunted their family for so many years.The film has a retro 1970's look and feel, and it is well-served as a tribute/follow-up to the original. Some familiar shots are mirrored and references to the original are noted through the dialogue ... though some of the humor seems a bit forced (specifically young Jibrail Nantambu who is being babysat). The opening credit sequence makes good use of the same font and color scheme from 40 years ago, and the rotten jack-o-lantern coming back to life is a nice touch.The return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie is what completes this haunting circle. Carpenter's HALLOWEEN was her big screen debut, and though she still tends to go over the-top at times, this obviously would not have worked without the daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. In fact, this story is mostly focused on the psychology of Laurie and her PTSD, as we never learn much about what makes Michael Myers do what he does. Others returning from the original film include Nick Castle as The Shape (though James Jude Courtney shares the role this time), and PJ Soles in an all-too-brief and quite memorable appearance. As a veteran cop, and described as the first officer on the scene 40 years ago, Will Patton's character appears to want to be anywhere but where he is (side note: Mr. Patton looks almost identical to Paul Simon these days).Huge carving knives gleaming (despite the low light) make several appearances, and many of Michael's grisly murders are handled off camera. But don't mistake that for a lack of violence or gore - there is an abundance. Keep in mind that the film is positioned as a direct sequel to the 1978 film, and fans of that classic should be quite satisfied. Even the iconic 1978 theme song is re-worked by John Carpenter, his grandson Cody Carpenter and musician Daniel A Davies. The recognizable notes are a bit slower and bulked up through synth. As with most horror films, it would be pretty easy to point out the flaws, inconsistencies and necessary assumptions, but it's one of the few that actually works if you avoid thinking too much and just ""enjoy"" the mythology and horror."
"Nothing here no there there! Halloween what worked there was a few homage scenes. The retro 80's music and the credits was okay. Well what did not work. So thin on story and characters. Halloween is so thin on a story that the only way Michael Myers can can find Laurie is by an unbelievable plot twist of the psychiatrist kills a cop and drives Michael to the house. Oh really, so lame. Even lamer, Michael escapes by another psyh ward transfer so so again, no original. Cut out all the other Halloween story lines and we got more the same old, same old which does not perform the slow burn turn the horror up notch by notch formula of the other Halloweens. There is a sisterhood empowerment characters sub story. Laurie has turned into a Ted Nuggent, N R A character who rambles, and is annoying. The audience is suppose to like the victims. No attachment with the gruff, unlikable Laurie character. All the guys in the film are lame and weak beta males, and or just clueless guys. Whinny, whimpering, irritating characters the viewers just hate. Again,there is no attachment to the characters. You need the alpha male character who gets killed for the false hope narrative. The jerk with the loud shirt who always dies the worst. The shrink is a narrator about Michael which was missing. No friendship with the younger people which builds a bond with the audience. Michael has to be like 80 by now, I mean the scare factor is not believable. All you have is the Laurie character who reminds the viewer of the over powering mother in the movie psycho! The trap at the end like really lame. Waiting for all this build up for that nothing ending, and or lack of ending. 5 out of 10 scares."
"Using only the original movie as canon, it's been 40 years since Michael Myers' rampage. He has been mute under the care of Dr. Sartain in Smith's Grove Sanitarium. True crime podcasters Aaron Korey and Dana Haines have come to entice Michael to speak by bringing along his mask. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has become an obsessive survivalist. She is estranged from her daughter Karen Nelson (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak).I think I expected too much. It's obvious that these guys have great respect for the franchise. The mechanics of the movie is well done and respectful of the original. There are issues with the writing. First, the retrieval of his mask cannot be an accident. It's convenience of story writing that annoyed me when it could have been a great way to show Michael's relentlessness. He should attack a motel where the two podcasters are staying. He could go from room to room murdering everyone until he found his mask. There is more horror in his relentless ruthlessness. In this movie, it's a happy accident. As for Laurie's house, I have issues with its construction. She's supposed to be obsessed with this inevitable situation and it's not as well prepared as it could be. First, there are a lot of windows. The walls seem thin. There should be one button to lock up the whole building and the windows (again) should be blocked by lowering metal bars. It makes no sense to set up basement to burn which seems to be more problematic than realistic. She should have better guns. She should have body armor. Did he bring in the mannequins or did Laurie have a bunch of them in the home? I do appreciate some of call-backs. This is a good horror. I'm just set for something great and it's a little disappointing."
"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic, as a horror film it is one of the most iconic ones and very influential. To this day it is still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters, and characters overall, in Michael Myers.The numerous follow-ups are very hit and miss (leaning towards the miss), with none of them being anywhere near as good and the quality decline generally was pretty drastic. 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' was an exception, while the Rob Zombie films and 'Halloween: Resurrection' were abominations. Hearing that there was going to be another film, part of me was really excited as it did look very creepy and word of mouth was positive. There was a little nervousness though as well, due to not being impressed generally with most of the 'Halloween' follow ups. Watched it though as part of my seeing as many 2018 films as possible quest, which has been a worthwhile one mostly but also hit and miss.Found myself breathing a big sigh of relief walking out of the cinema. While 'Halloween' (2018) is nowhere near as good as the 1978 classic, alongside 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' it is one of the best of the series since. There are flaws and it is not one of my favourites of the year, but there are a lot of strengths and there have been worse films this year. As far as 2018 horror films go, the year has been patchy for horror, it's one of the best ones on the most part.Starting with 'Halloween's' (2018) problems, some of the humour is misplaced and out of kilter too much with the rest of the film and a few elements of the story could have been explored and gone further more.The big twist also didn't seem fully realised although a brave one and the ending felt rushed and abrupt, also felt that there could have been more tension and less unintentionally silly camp. Have always been wary of open-ended endings and that they can be dangerous to do in case a planned sequel falls through.However, there is an awful lot to like about 'Halloween' (2018). Along with 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' it is the best looking of the follow-ups, it is very eerily shot and is close in style to the autumnal look and visual iconography of the original, something that most of the follow-ups failed to do. Loved the haunting music score, here an asset rather than a drawback in how it adds a lot to the atmosphere and enhances it, coming close too in being a character of its own.While flawed, the script is mostly smart with in-jokes and references that are effectively embedded and coming over as affectionate rather than random. There are humorous moments too. 'Halloween' (2018) succeeds in being fun and creepy, with the atmosphere being riddled with tension and suspense. The deaths are horrifyingly creative and the most shocking since 'Halloween H20', the gore not going overboard on the shock value or looking cheap, not distracting at all. The beginning is unsettlingly tense and Michael Myers has not been this freaky in a long time. Some moments have surprising heart and the scares made me jump and bite my nails. It was great for the film to return to the franchise's roots and treat the original with respect, while with enough new touches of its own. One of the better examples this year in attempts to cater to everybody.Didn't find myself annoyed by the characters and there was personality to them to stop them from being bland. 'Halloween' (2018) is one of the best acted 'Halloween' films. Jamie Lee Curtis has still got it, none of what made her character great is lost or forgotten, and Nick Castle is supremely terrifying as Myers.Concluding, didn't bowl me over but found myself enjoying it all the same. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"The Addams Family (2 out of 5 stars).The Addams Family is a boring and dull reboot to the Addams Family movies. The gothic and supernatural family is back in this animated feature. Although, it really lacked the spirit of the original movie. From a lackluster script and direction. Surely, kids may enjoy this movie more than adults. The humor and jokes are old and feeling outdated in this movie.The plot follows Gomez and Morticia getting married and chased away from their homeland from villagers. They find an abandoned asylum in New Jersey where they settle in too. They meet Lurch, an escaped mental patient (who looks more like Frankenstein). As years go by, their son Pugsley is preparing for a family coming of age tradition. While Wednesday, their daughter wants to experience the world. Away from there sheltered house. Which there town is growing with new neighbors. And a reality tv host Margaux, who is trying to build a perfect neighborhood and wants to rid of that old house.The plot is decent about a story of a family trying to keep to themselves. Wednesday is wanting to explore. And meets a friend who is tired of hiding who she wants to be with her lifestyle. It is a cute and charming story. The script and direction lacked in making any of these interesting characters fun to watch. They are all dull and forgettable. The animation is dreadfully boring. It is no Tim Burton's style. The directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan failed to make their film stick out.Overall, The Addams Family is a bad film. The reboot on turning it into an animation failed terribly. With dull animation. Boring and outdated humor. The script and direction lacked in making this film worth watching."
Fun for kids but they picked wrong actress to play wednesday and it has cliche villain
"The Addams Family is a remake of the 1991 live action film about the gothic Addams family who live in a normal suburban town. This time the film features the voices of Charlize Theron, Oscar Issacs,Chloe Gracie Moretz and Bette Midler.
If you liked the original then you may like it. Alot of it reminded me of Hotel Translvania with the whole eccentric family befriending humans."
"Seemingly unpopular since its announcement, an animated version of ""The Addams Family"" seems like it should have been a relatively easy to adapt - but its insipid, unfunny writing hamstrings the movie from get go.Looking for somewhere free of rioting mobs to start their family Gomez Addams (Oscar Isaac) and his new wife Morticia (Charlize Theron) settle on an abandoned asylum in New Jersey. Years later, and now with two children, Wednesday (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard) - the Addams' macabre ideal is threatened by the redevelopment of the local town by Home Styling Guru Margaux (Allison Janney).Positives first, it looks OK. I actually quite like the look of the principle characters - though I acknowledge that this has been divisive for some other people. The rest of the CGI is fine, it's very much in the style of ""Despicable Me"" and when it has to move for a bit of an action scene, it's all nicely done. I felt that Wednesday was the most rounded of the characters, so it's at least fortunate that she is probably the driving force behind what narrative there is. There weren't many laughs, but what there was were usually generated by Nick Kroll's Uncle Fester.The problems with the film are all with the script and story. It's a lacklustre tale, lacking in set pieces or any real tension. It sets up bits of side plots a couple of times that don't actually end up going anywhere, Wednesday taking over the school, the tension between Morticia and Grandma, for example. It feels like the script was written and rewritten over and over again until it's just a loose collection of scenes with a narrative pasted over the top. Worse than that though, it's not funny. I don't think even the younger kids in the cinema where I saw it found it amusing and there's certainly very little for any adults, or older kids in there.Just about managed to stay awake for the run time, but I don't recommend you try it."
"I didn't go into this new version of ""The Addams Family"" expecting anything profound. I figured that it was some nice silly entertainment (with an obviously spooky bent) and I was right. Much like how the live-action versions addressed the fact that the Addamses were seen as weird for being different but were a perfectly decent family, this one features them resisting pressure from a developer/reality star who wants to create a monoculture (and has a thing for both surveillance and over-the-top hairdos).Nothing special, but enjoyable."
"Let's get some things off my chest from the start. The movie itself felt like it could have been shorter. It didn't seem necessary to be so long. Also I am in the corner of people not happy about the depiction of Bruce Lee and the ""excuse"" Tarantino came up with didn't really help that cause (first saying it's just fiction to then go on saying Bruce was like that/the way he portrayed him). Let's be clear, I never met Bruce, but the way he was depicted in here, felt disrespectful at times (making him look dumb for a joke that is also in the trailer).Having said all that, you do get the Tarantino genius and his flavor is there and can be seen overall. A friend commented on a scene (a dog being fed) and likened it to the relationship between Tarantino and the viewer. QT being Brad Pitt in that situation and the viewer of the movie being the dog. Patience is something that is rare and also something that Tarantino may not find in many viewers either.Acting is superb, editing is great and the story while far removed from the actual events, is fun to watch. So don't expect historical accuracy also don't expect Margot Robbie to talk much. That doesn't mean she doesn't have an impact. It also doesn't mean QT is sexist. It's just another thing critics will latch onto since there's no motherf'in Samuel L. Jackson here to just spew the n word.While mostly slow and really mellow, there are some violent moments in here that may be too much for some viewers. Be warned, this is Tarantino after all. And he can get explicit in his depiction of violence. This is also a movie that is able to grow on you, even after initial rejection ... but that will be up to you and your willlingness to think about it way after you watched it"
"What could of; what should of; not everyone is going to find this Quentin Taranti no flick to their liking...nor to their understanding. But entertaining, you betcha'. Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) , once a household name TV western star, is having trouble with his life after his six year TV ended. Fame and fortune is waning. His stunt double, Cliff (Brad Pitt), is as every by Rick's side , both trying to reinvent themselves as Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles is dying. Then all hell breaks loose at neighbor Sharon Tate's (Margo Robbie) house.This comedy, drama gets a little long in the tooth, clocking in at 2 hrs 41 minutes. Also appearing, even for a brief time, are Al Pacino, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Clu Gulager, Michael Madsen, Rumer Willis and Austin Butler.Exceptional soundtrack features the likes of: Deep Purple, Simon & Garfunkel, Joe Cocker, Bob Seeger, Roy Head and Paul Revere & The Raiders."

"Anyone who's very familiar with Quentin Tarantino knows he doesn't make conventional movies. So when watching his meandering narrative here, I just sat back and enjoyed his going wherever he feels he needs to go wherever it might lead us. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio play a stunt man and an actor, respectively, in the late '60s in Hollywood who get mixed with some real-life people resulting in an alternate timeline. I'll stop there and just say me and my movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this (though he thought it was pretty weird) and I certainly enjoyed both Tarantino's dialogue and climatic action scenes. Really fascinating to watch to on that note, I recommend Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood."
"'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' sounded like it would be a great film from the get go. Although Quentin Tarantino's films have been spotty in recent years, his best work such as 'Reservoir Dogs' and especially 'Pulp Fiction' are masterpieces. The cast consists of many immensely talented actors. It looked great from the advertising and who cannot help resist that title. That it was one of the year's most positively received films further added to the interest.Although it is not quite perfect, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to me was as great as hoped. One of Tarantino's best in direction, writing and as a film as an overall whole in recent years, towards the better end of his filmography and one of 2019's best films, its positive reception richly deserved. It is unmistakable Tarantino in a good way and a great representation of the cast, with many giving some of their best work in recent years.Will start with the very, very few things that didn't quite come off for my tastes. Some of the pace, especially for a film as long as it was, could have tightened and not every scene felt necessary. Actually would have trimmed some or all of Sharon Tate in the cinema, regardless of how beguiling the production values and Margot Robbie's (that smile is a beauty) acting were.Did think too that the Bruce Lee caricature and encounter were quite tasteless and anybody who was offended can't be blamed.That sounds like a film worth a 7 or 8 out of 10. The good things though were so amazing and the film was in a different league to a lot of films released this year that to me awarding 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' either of those scores felt too low. It looks wonderful, dazzlingly shot with shots filled to the brim with atmosphere, stylishly edited with a lovingly recreated period. Tarantino directs with great confidence and his distinctive style is all over it. The music is used sparingly, but the music choices are very effective when used. Particularly so the quite sinister use of ""Twelve Thirty"" in a scene that already makes one feel unnerved.Script has the hard-boiled edge necessary and has entertainment and intensity. A word of warning, there is a lot of profanity (am mentioning this because this is something that bothers people) but to me it didn't feel as gratuitous as feared. Some pacing issues aside, the story is often absorbing and is quite nostalgic and daring with expert melding of fact and fiction. A few great scenes are everything to do with the making of the western with Rick and the girl (fans of classic-era westerns will enjoy it, likewise anybody with super fond memories of episodic television), Cliff's truly chilling encounter at the Spahn Movie Ranch and the splendidly over the top (and extremely violent just to warn you) finale in true Tarantino style.Found the characters to be interesting, with Rick and Cliff being quite meaty roles. The acting is exemplary, Leonardo DiCaprio is charisma and intensity personified and Brad Pitt, here the epitome of cool, has not been this good in years. Margot Robbie is absolutely radiant with a smile that lights up the screen. Bruce Dern, Damian Lewis and Al Pacino provide delicious support in small roles.In conclusion, the odd pacing issue and one tasteless scene aside this was a great film. 9/10"
"For 400 years, men have been searching the Amazon to find the Tears of the Moon, the flower petals of a legendary tree which can cures any illness or curse. It's 1916 London. Siblings Lily (Emily Blunt) and MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) steal an arrowhead artifact from the Royal Society. It's the key to finding the tree. They are pursued by the ruthless Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons). They hire a boat skippered by Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson). Joachim reawakens cursed Spanish conquistadors led by Aguirre (Edgar Ramírez).As an action adventure, this is fairly good. It's trying to be The African Queen with a healthy dose of Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not as good as either. The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt is pretty good but it's strictly platonic. They have no romantic heat. It's the fun banter of kidding best friends. Anyone watching them interact in real life would notice their natural chemistry. It's a basic chemistry test mistake. Quite honestly, I would be more than happy to have these two turn into adventure best buddies. Maybe they could find the romantic chemistry eventually in the later movies but they don't have it in this one. I like Paul Giamatti and am disappointed that he doesn't follow them up the river. Jesse Plemons is going full cartoon in his villain acting but maybe somebody else could do it better. Still, it's a fun ride while it lasted."
"""Jungle Cruise"" is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we follow a small group of people on their riverboat cruise and their search of Lágrimas de Cristal Tree. They have to search for it and even face Don Aguirre who led the Spanish conquistadors to South America in 1556 for it.I liked this movie very much because the plot was very interesting and the interpretations of the cast were simply amazing. The movie became even better with some plot twists that I did not expect and some very clever details that were presented. The interpretations of both Emily Blunt who played as Lily Houghton and Dwayne Johnson who played as Frank Wolff were very good and their combination worked very well. The direction which was made by Jaume Collet-Serra it was also very good and he succeeded on creating a bond between his main characters and the audience. Finally, I have to say that ""Jungle Cruise"" is an interesting movie and I strongly recommend it to everyone because I am sure it will travel you and you will have a great time watching it."
I absolutely love Jaume Collet Saura directed horror films many years ago and now does action/kid's movies. Emily Blunt is gorgeous and Dwane Johnson is always entertaining to watch in role in my role I appreciate all his work! Simple story about a flower that can heal anything might not be for everyone but damn sure is well filmed throughout and has spot on comedy that was well written. Love or hate this movie I highly recommend it!
"What I cannot figure out about this genre of Disney movie is that if people want to see one of these theme park attractions, why don't they go to Anaheim or Lake Buena Vista? Johnny Depp may be an answer, I guess.The movie is, for want of a better description, very Disney-sque. There is no point for me to get into the plot, other than offering a simple advice: don't challenge it. The thrills (Disney-sque, remember) and the somewhat underused cast are probably worth your 2 hours 7 minutes, although 1 hour 40 minutes would be better.Emily Blunt, as an expert English botanist in the beginning of the 20th century does a lot more talking than when we last saw her in ""A quiet place II"". Dwayne Johnson as an eccentric con man cum jungle cruise operator in the Amazon is in familiar territory. Edgar Ramirez, last seen as a taciturn and persevering detective in the mini-series ""The undoing"" is a trapped, tortured soul existing in perpetual twilight zone. Astonishingly versatile and prolific Paul Giamatti, whose most recent appearance for me is in the series ""Billions"", is all but wasted here as a caricature of an Italian money man. Similarly caricature, but a little more used, is Jesse Plemons playing the villain, a German prince. I cannot quite decide which of his two excellent portraits I like better, ""The butcher"" in the TV series ""Fargo"", or the creepy neighbour policeman in ""Game night""."
"A bit like Chris Pratt, I like Dwayne Johnson. He's an out and out entertainer - there is nothing complicated about his presentation, and here is no different. This is just a family adventure film that sees him taking his clients ""Lily"" (Emily Blunt) and her posh brother ""MacGregor"" (Jack Whitehall) on a search to find a tree with leaves that might have amazing recuperative powers that could eradicate illness. Along the way, they have to battle a jungle brimming with hungry beasties and with some recently revived ancient conquistadors who have an agenda all of their own. The visual effects are as you'd expect from Disney and as far as it goes this is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight piece of cinema. It's derivative, certainly - it has shades of ""The Mummy"" (1999) to the storyline alongside a bit of ""Dead Man's Chest"" (2006) with Whitehall reminding me a lot of the John Hannah character from the former, but it still moves along apace and though hardly taxing for the adults, it ought to keep the young ones entertained for what did seem a slightly over long 2hrs-odd."
"I guess if the producers wanted to make another Blade Runner, they totally succeeded - at least so far. As with the original Blade Runner the visuals are the ones that people will refer to when it comes to this movie. And it's not just because of the Academy Awards. You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).Having said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.While it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it. If that sounds intriguing to you, with some added social commentary flavor, than by all means watch it. But beware that you have to have patience with it ..."
"This film tells the story of a modified, manufactured man who hunts down and kill old versions of manufactured men. The discovery of a secret makes him re- evaluate his life and values.It is unfortunate that""Blade Runner 2049"" is so desperate to impressed with great lighting, to the point that it ignores the story. Scenes drag on several times the length needed to tell a story, making the film overly long. The first hour already felt like eternity, and the next 100 minutes were even longer. People in the cinema were restless, head resting on hands or just looked at the ground because it was so boring. The story was thin, and could have been told in a short time. Even the drowning scene had no sense of thrill, urgency or threat. It is simply plain boring."
"It's 2049 Los Angeles. K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner hunting for old Nexus 8 replicants under LAPD Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). After the 2022 blackout, most records have been erased or corrupted. Tyrell is out of business and replicant production had been outlawed until Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace is producing a new obedient replicant. Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is his replicant henchwoman. K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K's holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.This is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original's visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.The original's detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins' work is beyond beautiful. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. Gosling is a more effective lead. Ford comes in during the second half and is a more fun Deckard. Ana de Armas is a gorgeous vision of girl perfection. Sylvia Hoeks is an amazing villain. The movie tackles all of the ideas without hitting one over the head. This is a great film although I'm not sure if popular modern audience will take to it. The opening box office certainly does not suggest that."
"Watching ""Blade Runner 2049"" makes me want to go back and see the original film again. In some ways I thought this was the better movie, and I know I'm probably causing a rumble with that statement. But there was a lot of nuance built into the story of the long out of action Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), and it's a credit to the writers and film makers that his identity as a human or a replicant was kept ambiguous for this story. My gut tells me he's human, but then again, if Rachael (Sean Young) was a replicant, then how does that work with the concept of a live birth as the central mystery of the story? So yes, many questions, very few answers.One thing is certain, if the movie hadn't gotten the Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual Effects, then they might as well have just hung up the award. The CGI was outstanding and some of the concepts that got play were stunning, as in the character of K's (Ryan Gosling) holographic girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas). That's not to say there weren't some inconsistencies in the story line. For example, K's status as a new line replicant designed to obey didn't exactly match up with his actions throughout the picture, and I wasn't persuaded that an eventual discovery of a replicant offspring would be all that catastrophic as advanced by Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). Taking things in stride, those matters didn't prove to be a big deal but they were somewhat distracting.So over all, I thought the film was masterfully done with exceptional cinematography and dazzling effects. I'd like to special mention those hologram images of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as being well done, but the Frank Sinatra sequence was a sure bet, as the song he was singing brought me all the way back to a 1948 picture called ""Road House"" with Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark. He could have been crooning about this film when he sang ""Make it one for my baby, and one more for the road""."
"Here's the long-awaited sequel to the Ridley Scott hit, but unfortunately it ended up in the hands of director Denis Villeneuve instead - a man I find criminally overrated after the threesome of PRISONERS, SICARIO and ARRIVAL all failed to impress me. BLADE RUNNER 2049 is similarly glacial in its construct, with the director seemingly unable to inject any warmth into his film whatsoever. As such, the performances feel artificial (maybe that was the intent) and you don't really care about any of what you see. Harrison Ford's the most interesting thing in this, and it's criminal to make the audience wait two hours to meet him again. Elsewhere, the endless CGI scenery is admittedly beautiful, but the plot is surprisingly slight - reminiscent of ANGEL HEART at times, but weaker. Watch it for the visuals if you must, but otherwise this is weak sauce compared to the first."
"I kept waiting for something to happen that had even an element of surprise. The plot has to do with a character who is great at using the stock market to his advantage and then spreading the loot around. He has a group of dysfunctional sociopaths working for him and for some reason they are successful. This is all contrived to make things move along and be interesting. As the profits rise, there is more and more debauchery that is about as graphic as anything I've seen. The interesting thing is that it is not erotic; it is just plain boring. DiCaprio has a lot of lines and gets to emote like crazy, reveling in his excessive use of drugs and his lack of any kind of commitment. I suppose this is so outrageous that we viewers who are not with it don't realize it is tongue in cheek. I knew where the principle plot was going and had a hard time imagining that so many people could exist under these circumstances. It's just rotten people doing rotten things to other people. It's like Caligula has been reborn in the 21st Century."
"There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. And that is OK, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That's why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not.If you don't feel like it, don't watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving ""carefully"", that has to be seen to be believed ..."
"This film tells the story of Jordan Belfort and how he made the fortune that funded his life of excess. After a brief prologue where he explains that he made millions and consumed vast quantities of various drugs we return to his first day on Wall Street; he is on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder but he knows he wants to get to the top... then a market crash puts him out of work. Instead of working at a prestigious Wall Street firm he ends up pushing penny stocks, basically junk, to people who can't really afford the losses they will surely face. It is profitable though and he quickly realises he can make a real fortune selling junk to rich people. He teams up with similarly minded people and creates a 'respectable' firm; soon he is dubbed 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and everybody wants to work for him. He gets a new wife, a large yacht and does even more drugs... his main problem is how to secure his money so that the authorities can't get it when they finally catch up with him... and he knows they will one day if he isn't careful.This film is all about excess; it could take a prurient view but instead it revels in it... Jordon Belford and his friends may be drug-taking womanisers were few if any morals but for three hours they are good company. Belford is a charismatic central character; at times he reminded me of Charles Foster Kane, from 'Citizen Kane' at other times he was more like Tony Montana from 'Scarface' without the violence. As fast as he rises it is clear that he will ultimately fall. Leonardo DiCaprio is on top form as Belford; I can only suspect that the amorality of the character stopped him getting major awards. The supporting cast is solid too; most notably Margot Robbie who is great as Naomi, Belford's second wife; and Jonah Hill as Donnie, his closest associate. It must be stated that this film isn't for the easily offended; there is prodigious swearing, lots of drug taking, a fair amount of sex and nudity and a small amount of violence... if you aren't offended by that it is a lot of fun. Given that I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting an entertaining romp of a movie."
""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal "" In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic form To be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ? This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director."
"I kept waiting for something to happen that had even an element of surprise. The plot has to do with a character who is great at using the stock market to his advantage and then spreading the loot around. He has a group of dysfunctional sociopaths working for him and for some reason they are successful. This is all contrived to make things move along and be interesting. As the profits rise, there is more and more debauchery that is about as graphic as anything I've seen. The interesting thing is that it is not erotic; it is just plain boring. DiCaprio has a lot of lines and gets to emote like crazy, reveling in his excessive use of drugs and his lack of any kind of commitment. I suppose this is so outrageous that we viewers who are not with it don't realize it is tongue in cheek. I knew where the principle plot was going and had a hard time imagining that so many people could exist under these circumstances. It's just rotten people doing rotten things to other people. It's like Caligula has been reborn in the 21st Century."
"One in four people will experience mental illness in their lifetime, but only a very small percentage of those will pose any sort of danger to anyone other than themselves. Hopefully, as more people talk about openly about mental health, stigma will decrease, and all those in need of help will get the treatment they require.There will, of course, always be cases that slip through the net with tragic results, people like Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose fragile psyche is the result of a lifetime of hurt: a victim of child abuse, a victim of violence, a victim of intolerance, a victim of circumstance, a victim of inequality, and a victim of a society that doesn't care. No longer functioning as a rational human being (his access to meds having been taken away), Fleck confuses reality and fantasy, is prone to outbursts of extreme violence, and dances wildly to inappropriate pop music from the '70s.With a tour-de-force performance from Phoenix, whose turn as the green-haired villain is both sympathetic and terrifying, plus stylish direction from Todd Phillips, and an intelligent script that is, by turns, funny, sad, exciting, and horrific, Joker is a refreshingly bold attempt to do something with a well known comic-book character that doesn't involve expensive CGI-laden battles.9/10. The only part that I didn't like was where it is revealed that Arthur's relationship with his pretty neighbour has been a figment of his imagination. I think most people would have got this without the need to spell it out for them."
"This is ""Joker"", a 2019 movie and the title is really telling what/who it is about. But first things first: The director is Todd Phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2-hour movie. Phillips is still mostly known for his Hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with Zach Galifianakis. So gently-speaking, the filmmaker's career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics. This one here is no exception either. General movie-goers apparently really loved it, but critics not so much. A bit like Bohemian Rhapsody not too long ago. That one I really adored though, this one here not so much. Still I am a big Joaquin Phoenix fan and as such, it is impossible to give the film a thumbs-down overall. He is the movie. And I am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise I maybe would not have liked it at all. Not just because of personal preference, but also because Phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene. Not too long ago, Jared Leto played the Joker (Batman's nemesis) and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But let's not drift away from this film here now. For Phoenix, all the hype is justified and well-deserved. I think he is still up there and a potential contender for the Oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and I read that it could be between him and Adam Driver and I like both for being slightly oddball, so I certainly approve. Of course with stuff like Her, The Master and my personal favorite Walk the Line under his belt, it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette, but I still hope he does. If we consider Daniel Day-Lewis retired now, he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under 50, that is quite impressive. At least in my opinion, but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well. He does so much with his eyes. Okay you get the message, I thought he was an amazing Joker.Sadly I cannot say the same about the film itself really. There are good moments here and there, no denying at all, but I was still not satisfied with the script I must say. It felt to me that, most of all, they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser, but somehow I must say that the film felt zero daring to me. Even the interactions with the Wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material, felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all. I did like, however, that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the Joker who kills Bruce's father in the end because of the personal connection, but it was just one of his ""army"" eventually and it does not matter who did it. Joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore, he has others who do so for him. Also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on (his mother, De Niro's character most of all) are killed by him. I must say I did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother. I mean as for the colleague at his apartment, it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short. But still the cops were following him and that was accurate. There, however, Clownmania was already going on in full force you could say. Big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away? I would say I disagree.In general, this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonist's head. Like his relationship with the neighbor, but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake, even if I did not see it coming. Of course also the relationship between his mother and Mr. Wayne (okay that seemed fairly far-fetched from the beginning, I mean Joker cannot be Batman's half-brother can he?) or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about De Niro's character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera, which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show. So this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be 100% sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence, such as the killing of the three young men on the subway. Or the talk show host murder. Or the killing of his mother? Or maybe is that fake too? I mean it is a big step, even if she did invent the relationship with Bruce's dad. He really really cares for her. And he won't kill the colleague who always treated him well. I thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and the guy is too small to reach the knob/key, but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually. He is a psychopath yes, but with his very own unpredictable style. Of course, there are aside from that these moments with all the over-the-top laughing, most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines. Now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else, the average people.Okay, I think this would be pretty much all then. I mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me. Maybe, most likely, you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from. There is hardly one that is really weak and I think the running time was accurate too and I don't say that too often about 2-hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions, so you can see it as a compliment. But like I mentioned previously already, those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of Phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing. I think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying, which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing. This also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow. There is a fairly memorable quote from Fleck (Joker in his ""human form"") about that that they really could have made a lot with (also they included it in the trailer) story-wise, but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me. Okay we get it. Gotham is not at a good place to be right now, but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly. Okay that would be all then I liked and disliked about this film. It certainly won't make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the Oscars for Best Picture, that is too much I think, but I wish Phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness. There was always a lot of arguing about who's the best Joker. Nicholson? Ledger? Hamill? Romero? There is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now. All in all, the film gets a thumbs-up from me."
"Right out of the gate you can forget about considering this a comic book movie. It may be based on a comic book character, but the character development and story line can be taken right from the pages of modern day horrors brought about by poverty, abusive parents, disrespect for authority, the distance between the haves and the have-nots, and an uncaring society at large. With a plot often times structured on ambiguity, the film explores the troubled mind of one Arthur Fleck, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in what may eventually go down as the crowning achievement of his acting career. No offense intended to Jokers who have gone before, but Phoenix's take on the character now becomes the standard for others to follow, but virtually impossible to match. I must say, the hype engendered by the film prior to it's release relative to the amount of violence portrayed appears to be seriously overstated. Yes, there is violence on Arthur Fleck's part, all of it gruesome, but it virtually pales in comparison to what one might experience in any chapter of the 'Saw' series for example, or any number of slasher/gore flicks that rely on buckets of blood to 'entertain' fans of that persuasion. Together, director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have created a complex character and a complex film dealing with the horrific and sordid side of mental illness that finds it's release in savage, sociopathic behavior. Though he may be called the Joker, as Arthur Fleck himself would surely attest, ""...no one's laughing now""."
"For me the best thing about this movie was that finally someone put a bullet where it did the most good - right in the heart of De Niro. Apart from that this was what amounted to a Case study of a sociopath who wasn't playing with a full deck with aspects of so many previous films - Death Wish, Taxi Driver - that it was difficult to locate any 'original' element. Clearly it has its admirers; good luck to them."
"In Gotham City, the clown and aspirant comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an outcast mentally disturbed man that lives with his deranged mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). When the social service office that attends him is shutdown, Arthur stops his medication and the abusive society drives him crazier to a criminal life.""Joker"" is a dark and depressive film that discloses a dramatic version of the Joker´s origin. Joaquin Phoenix has a top-notch performance in the role of a mentally disturbed man disregarded by the society with a nervous twitch. His acting makes the viewer recalls and compares with Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"", the best so far. The dark and gruesome cinematography shows a dirty Gotham City with the garbage collector strike. The music score is also spectacular with hits from the 70´s and 80´s. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Coringa"" (""Joker"")"
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment.  It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects.  It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department.  But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.  A little long but never really boring, Harrpy Potter offers up a nice stew of excitement on this thanksgiving weekend with some great visuals and score (from John Williams).  Yet it is not a great film.  Grade: between A- and B+"
"How sad it is to begin the reader's comments with a whining, complaining, drone against everything about this movie. Why not pick a balanced view. Good grief! Did someone poison your dog? It made it sound like this doesn't compare favorably with ""Hamburger: The Movie."" I am a over fifty years old and thought I would be pretty lukewarm to a ""kids"" movie. I have been listening for a year to kids raving about the Harry Potter books. Their eyes light up--they are enthused about a ""book."" When I went to see it, I had just read the book the night before because I like to see how they translate. The script was delightful. The characters were charming. The acting in this movie is wonderful--were you expecting Bergman? The pacing is delightful. The sets are eerie and forbidding. I thought that the wonderment of the characters was there in full force. Who did you have in mind to play Harry? Are there any actors that you approve of? Perhaps Kevin Spacy should have played Harry. How about the blond girl from American Beauty as Hermione. Johnny Depp as Ron Weasley. Oh yeah--as I recall, Stephen Spielberg has made a couple of pretty decent movies.We are introduced to the Harry Potter canon as he becomes a foundling, taken into a family that mistreats him and has no respect for his general goodness. Of course, they pay a price for their insensitivity and Harry takes the magical journey to enroll at Hogwarts. It is obvious that his coming has great import for everyone. He meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and they begin a quest to locate the Sorcerer's Stone. We find out about Voldemort and the curse that hangs over Hogwarts, going back centuries. We are also introduced to Quiddich which will be a staple for all episodes. Harry also must struggle with what happened to his parents and, like Frodo in ""Lord of the Rings,"" his quest and what it means. Outstanding film."
"This first film in the Harry Potter series spends a lot of time setting up the story for the later instalments while still managing to be entertaining in its own right.The three leads all look very meek, mild and very young but still give good performances alongside their established nearly all British elders. The plot moves along at a quick pace and the former Home Alone director Collumbus is able to combine the magic and humour from the original novel with all the darkness and visual aids that only cinema could offer. Although the warmth can be a little cloying at times the balance is by and large good.Overall a solid first instalment to the series and a must for anyone discovering Potter for the first time."
"Here's an event movie that holds up to being an event. This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The film is the first installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman. It features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, John Cleese, and Fiona Shaw co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by Chris Columbus. The story follows Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his magical education. Upon his 11th birthday, Harry Potter, who lives in misery with an aunt and uncle that don't want him, learns from a giant named Hagrid that he is the orphaned son of powerful wizards. Harry is offered a place at prestigious Hogwarts, a boarding school for wizards that exists in a realm of magic and fantasy outside the dreary existence of normal humans or ""Muggles."" At Hogwarts, Harry quickly makes new friends and begins piecing together the mystery of his parents' deaths, which appear not to have been accidental after all. Being so faithful to the book is both the movie's strength and weakness. The movie unfolds exactly as written in the book, so there is little room for surprises or discoveries.The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a crème de la crème cast.A combination of computer graphics, detailed sets, and real-life locations gives the film the authenticity its fans expect.The second-half adventure doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel.This is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. Writer Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus keep the spooks in check, making this a true family film, and with its resourceful hero wide-eyed and ready, one can't wait for Harry's return.But nevertheless,it still manages to be a complete triumph for it is a near-perfect commercial and cultural commodity."
"If you don't know your Potter (like me), than you might have a problem with the titles. With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o) But enough about my (let's call it) ignorance, for the books (haven't read them guilty as charged) and off to the movie itself. Which is obviously targeted at a young audience. And it delivers on this premise. Plus it has to introduce characters to the world (for those who know them and those who don't). A good job overall, but nothing great in my eyes ..."
"I heard about this film a reasonably high amount at the time of its release, mainly because of the cast and it being directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network), so I had to try it. Based on the true story, during the late 1960's and early 1970's there is a serial killer terrorising the San Francisco Bay Area, calling himself Zodiac, taunting the police with details of his victims and their bodies, and leaving cryptic messages at the scene of the crime. These letter are in a way clues as to his crime plans and his identity, and in this slightly fictionalised vision of events, we see the press and investigators trying to solve the case of this murderer. We see the investigations by crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and police Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), both not really getting anywhere, and then of course there is cartoonist San Francisco Chronicle worker Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). He has a high interest in solving puzzles, e.g. crosswords, so with maybe a little help from the outside he sees it his mission to break the cryptic clues and catch the Zodiac killer, much to the annoyance of now alcohol drowning Paul. He obviously gains some support from David, and he also comes into contact with other people working on the case, such as handwriting expert Sherwood Morrill (Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall), Linda del Buono (The Astronaut's Wife's Clea DuVall) who knew one of the Zodiac killer's victims, and key suspect Arthur Leigh Allen (Volcano's John Carroll Lynch). Of course the investigation becomes an obsession for Robert, so much so that he neglects and loses his wife Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) and family, as well as his job, but he continues nevertheless, the ending makes it unclear whether the investigation into the Zodiac is truly is over. Also starring Top Gun's Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, Who Framed Roger Rabbit's Charles Fleischer as Bob Vaughn, Zach Grenier as Mel Nicolai, Elias Koteas as Sgt. Jack Mulanax, Donal Logue as Captain Ken Narlow and My Best Friend's Wedding's Dermot Mulroney as Captain Marty Lee. I will admit I got lost slightly in a couple of places, and I think it could have been improved a little with more murders featured, but Gyllenhaal does well, Downey Jr. isn't bad, and Ruffalo gets his time, and of course the director does his best, it is in moments an engaging real life story, a watchable crime drama based on a true story. Good!"
"For those deeply interested in the mystery of the Zodiac serial killer, this portrayal of one man's obsession with discovering the murderer's identity will no doubt qualify as essential viewing, dwelling as it does on the minutiae of the infamous unsolved case for a solid two and a half hours. Every possible avenue is examined in-depth; the script—based on the bestseller by Robert Graysmith—is exhaustive, charting the investigation of the killer's activity from the late 60s through to the early 90s. In its attention to detail, Zodiac is hard to fault.Unfortunately, in concentrating so hard on delivering the facts whilst avoiding sensationalism at all cost, director David Fincher neglects to engage those members of the audience who wish to be entertained as well as informed. With the exception of a brief moment of tension in a potential suspect's basement, the film never attempts to engage the viewer on an emotional level, and the result is a very dry watch—dare I say it, even boring at times. It's certainly nowhere near as memorable an experience as Fincher's other classic serial killer flick, Se7en (1995)."
"This is a film about the infamous Zodiac killer. It starts in 1969 and spans over 2 1/2 hours to 1991, The film centers on Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who is obsessed with solving the crime which involves a fellow reporter and numerous police officials. He accuses a number of suspects, each of which lacks for a hand writing or fingerprint match.The film shows a few murders, but is hardly gruesome. The exciting scenes consisted of opening letters from the zodiac and Jake scratching his head. It was a rather boring police drama.There is a cutout of ""Dirty Harry"" in one of the scenes, a man who got his ""zodiac style"" killer.Interesting as a history, but not as a crime drama.Parental Guide: no f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
"A crackling good crime story from director David Fincher, who meticulously mounts this impeccable and brutal true-life mystery with aplomb. A serial killer self-nicknamed ""The Zodiac"" is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who's employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper's reporting of (and the police department's concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith's non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it's quite riveting. Amazingly, no Oscar nominations. *** from ****"
"A couple of years ago, I read an article about how some people are still obsessed with the Zodiac serial killer case. Since the murderer was never apprehended, this case has fascinated a number of people for almost 40 years. There are websites and all kinds of people, apparently, who can't let go of this famous case. Lo and behold - here's a movie about that obsession. I, probably like a number of viewers, thought this was just another film about the murderer, and it looked that way for the first hour of the 157-minute movie. However, it turns out be just as much a story about one guy who has this obsession about finding the killer. That man is ""Robert Graysmith,"" a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on Graysmith's books on the Zodiac killer, so it's no surprise the story winds up revolving around him.For moviegoers looking for a hard-nosed, brutal serial-killer story, this must have been a disappointing film because it turns out to be a character study of ""Graysmith"" plus an in- depth behind-the-scenes look at police procedure which, as any cop could tell you, can be tedious work. However, there is still is enough violence and suspense, particularly early on, to satisfy some and there is a lot of information on the crimes itself, and a lot of suspects to entertain the ""whodunit"" mystery-solving viewer.I admit the story began to drag a bit after two hours but overall, I thought it was an intelligent, interesting profile of all concerned: most-likely killer, detectives, newsmen, witnesses, other suspects, Graysmith's wife - everyone who could possibly been involved with this long-standing unanswered crime case. In a way, this story reminded me of the CSI shows on TV where every five minutes we get a new can't-miss suspect who turns out to be a false lead. However, in this story, no one was ever tried and convicted. But, the movie does come to a conclusion on who the guilty party was, and makes a convincing case for it. Thus, at least according to the film, Mr. Graysmith's work was not in vain. (The real-life suspect died of a heart attack, so we may never know for sure.)The downside for Mr. Graysmith, and people we may not even know about, was that his life and others have been radically altered for the worse this obsession to find the Zodiac killer. It cost Mr. Graysmith his marriage.Overall, this is a bit long but it features excellent acting by everyone and offers diverse characters. I would like to have seen more with Arthur Allen. John Carroll Lynch is not a big- name actor but he's good and, for obvious reasons, a fascinating person in this story. Director David Fincher doesn't offer up the edge-of-your-seat thrillers as he did in ""Se7en"" and ""Panic Room,"" but this is still worth a look and recommended."
"5/10 - what could've been something really exhilarating and left you wanting more, this action blockbuster wasted the talents of its cast, gave little worth remembering, and failed to give the franchise the jolt it needed."
"There's a lot of action in the film, from guns to sword fights. There are times when the plot is not so convincing, such as when Akiko trusts snake eyes all of a sudden, or when snake eyes can fight with a sword skillfully on a motorcycle. It is nonetheless entertaining."
"First of all, this has *nothing* to do with G. I. Joe, as it is a medieval story about two Japanese clans and the protagonist is caught somewhat in between. Yes, it happens today, but 90% of all fights are using swords and the prize of the war is a magical stone. It's like someone took an existing Japanese samurai and ninjas script, added an extraneous character and made him the protagonist, then plastered on a Joe/Cobra connection and brought it into the present. And the way they added this stuff is like fixing a broken mirror with industrial sticky tape on the visible side.And what a cast this had: Andrew Koji from Warrior (I still crave for a new season), Iko Uwais from Raid, Peter Mensah from Spartacus, Takehiro Hira (who in my mind did the best job in the film, even if he was the villain and had a really dumb role), Samara Weaving from Guns Akimbo. Not to mention Eri Ishida, who did more in a few scenes than ""Snake Eyes"" in the entire film. They did nothing with all of this. The fights were fractured and made little sense, focused on form and ignoring substance. Two people fighting 50 and succeeding because they all used swords and the heroes had unlimited stamina, the usual running (slowly and awkwardly) from bullets scene, people running in the sword range to fire a gun, ugh! It was incredibly ugly. Even the motorcycle and car scenes were ridiculously bad. A team of 5 snipers could have finished *everybody* without loses.Worst of all, it's called G. I. Joe Origins and it features a character who has never heard of the Joes in a time when both Cobra and Joes have been established for a long time. There is no origin story at all! There is no story, really!Bottom line: this film is something that whole teams of people should be fired because of. A 100 million dollar film that manages to waste every resource it bought. Avoid it like it's the plague."
"Found it (Dr.) Strange this movie, the BumbleBee of the 'Joes, didn't come out years ago. This felt very 2005.One of the perks for me to see this movie was the breathtaking sight of Henry Golding, but he had to know, if this was successful, none of us would see OR hear him again. Honestly, since that's the case with the character - he's mute + never takes off his helmet, they might as well save money and recast him.But, I digress. This movie was pretty good, beautifully shot and probably the best of the G. I. Joeverse. Also: it was horribly edited with action scenes at times incomprehensible and predictable as all hell. And I'm not just saying that because it's a prequel of sorts.Bruce Wayne, sorry, I mean ""Snake Eyes"" sees his dad murdered right in front of him and spends his off-screen time growing into adulthood by seeking revenge and becoming a clawless Wolverine. Lucky for him, two different Japanese clans want to use him.Cue music: Some of them want to use him. Some of them want to get used by him. Some of them want to abuse him. Some of them want to be abused.Still fits. Anyways, my other draws for seeing this opening weekend: I played with, watched and read G. I. Joe as a child and Snake Eyes was always my favorite and the best-looking Asian actor/martial artist, Iko Uwais, had a part. Mercifully, Iko's in it a lot more than I expected. I thought he'd play a bit part, but he was a good scene stealer.I liked the rest of the cast and characters, especially Tommy (the bro,) Takehiro (the Anti---hero,) Blind Master (the cliché,) Baroness (the always great bi+ch) and Scarlett (my favorite Babysitter.) They all did what they could with their roles as the story could've been better and took a long time to get where we knew it would evolve to.So, despite feeling like the recent Black Widow - both 2021 ""Origin"" stories, but feel dated already - it's a fun action/adventure with tons of action and gorgeous Asian men.***Final Thoughts: I'd have to rewatch the first 2 - haven't in probably 7 or so years, but I'd have to say Snake Eyes was the best one. I recall not liking the 2nd one much and the first, I was a huge defender of. It was everything I'd hope the Transformers Movie would've been and more. (I grew up with both toys and liked Transformers way more than G. I. Joe, but with the movies, this series far outdid the terrible Michael Bay films.)"
When will the nonsense of everyone speaking English even when Americans make films about other cultures end?
"Dani (Florence Pugh) and her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) join a few of his buddies on a trip to a small remote Swedish village for its midsummer festival. Dani needs a distraction from her parent's deaths. This little trip is surreal and a profound distraction. This movie is a different type of scary. And involves a different kind of fear. A bit slow, like having one hand tied...but you are afraid to untie yourself.There is some full nudity and traumatic imagery. For sure worth your investment."
"First of all I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to the negative reviewers on here. Normally I tend to listen more to the negative than the positive reviewers as often there are alot of fake positive reviews from people involved in a movie. But in this case the high rating it got from more then 100000 voters made me watch it, and I can't say I regret it. The cinematography is great, the acting is pretty good, and the story is captivating. I'm normally not a big fan of long movies, and in this case I even watched the director's cut that is 30 minutes longer, and never did I get a boring feeling. For that the story is too suspenseful, there is an evil dark ambiance to it that wants you to watch more. Movies about cults are most of the time interesting to watch as those people have a complete different lifestyle to ours, and mostly because they're deranged and/or brainwashed. Watching crazy people act weird, isn't that entertainment? To me it is for sure. Ari Aster did a very good job with this movie, that slow building tension all a long is brilliant. Personally I would have put a more oppressing and dark soundtrack to it, to make it more evil but that's just my opinion. Midsommar is a good movie in this genre, better than I thought it would be."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. We are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker Ari Aster cares little for tradition. Well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. His feature film debut was last year's mega-hit HEREDITARY, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association Top 10 list for 2018.HEREDITARY was filled with darkness and dread, and Mr. Aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as Dani (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. During her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor, SING STREET) is a bit strained. The brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking Dani's family. Christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends.An awkward group conversation leads Dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to Sweden. The purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for Josh (William Jackson Harper, ""The Good Place"") to work on his thesis. The other guys in the group are Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) whose family in Sweden is hosting the festival, and Mark (Will Poulter, THE REVENANT) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions.And with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. Try to picture a Folk Horror Comedy Fairy Tale Break-up Pagan Cult film, which at any given time reminds of MOTHER!, THE WICKER MAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE VILLAGE, SUSPIRIA, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. It is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. And that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. Most of it is filmed outside during Sweden's Midnight Sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for Woodstock). The daylight messes with your senses and expectations. Bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. Although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen.So without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to Sweden mushroom trip, a Waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a Powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. We also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the Queen of May. Of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late!Ms. Pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, Haley Lu Richardson) is terrific here. Her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. The excellent music from Bobby Krlic, better known as The Haxan Cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. I was so shell-shocked at the end, that I'm unable to confirm that the version of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"" is that of The Walker Brothers (Scott Walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. Director Aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. The cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever."
"Some have Related the Psychedelic Experience to a Religious Epiphany.In His Follow-Up to the Mega-Hit ""Heredity"" (2018), Writer/Director Ari Aster has once Again gone to the ""Dark-Side"" of Family or Communal Allegory.The Look is Psychedelica with a Colorful Palette of Flowers Everywhere and Bright Costumes of Cult-Members Exhibiting some Very Dark Rituals and Bizarre Behavior.It's Florence Pugh that Centers the Film with a Personality Constantly on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown with Angst Oozing from every pour.Confused, Intimidated, and Largely Lost, even in a ""Normal"" Setting, Suffering from a Family Tragedy of the Suicide/Murder of Her Sister, Father, and Mother.So, the Poor ""Dani"" goes from Barely Coping to a Strange, to Say the Least, Environment of Completely Foreign Religious Rituals.With a Boy-Friend that is as Vacant and Vacuous as a Tree-Stump.What Goes On in ""Midsommar"" is the Stuff that Films Like ""The Wicker Man"" (1973) and others have Explored.But this Film-Maker makes Every Religious Minute of it Stretched to the Breaking Point that Onlookers like ""Dani"" and the Audience will have Trouble Keeping a Grip.The Movie is Disturbing, Unsettling, Disgusting, Beautiful, and gives us quite a Ride to the ""Other Side"" of the World both Figuratively and Culturally and it is one that Few will Find Routine.The Sunshine is Eternal On Screen and the Darkness Resides in the Mind and Spirit.A Gut-Wrenching, Glorious Take on the Horror Film and the Horrors of Indoctrinated Souls Bound by Tradition and Ethnocentric, Hubristic Capitulation."
"After a distressing family tragedy, Dani joins her rather indifferent boyfriend and his 3 college friends to attend summer solstice celebrations at the remote Swedish commune where one of them was brought up.When I saw the trailer, I thought ""This reminds me of The Wicker Man."" And I was right. If you are familiar with the original Wicker Man, this movie will not surprise you in the slightest. But is it any good?Well, it is beautifully photographed and there is some excellent sound design. There is a sense of creeping uneasiness, and some general nastiness here and there - it is a horror film, after all. The direction is sometimes very good, and sometimes a bit too much like showing off. And Florence Pugh is jaw-droppingly good.There is nothng by way of made-you-jump moments - not a bad thing, in my view.But there are a number of plot points which are inadequately dealt with which, to me, means they shouldn't have been there to start with - crass college pal Mark, for instance, whose attitude towards Dani has no payoff whatsoever. And this is particularly relevant given that this rather slight tale runs for 140 minutes. This tale unfolds at a pace which is a bit too leisurely. Losing half an hour would have improved the pace, losing an hour would have moved it along whip-fast.An excellent, and VERY disturbing final shot, though."
"Minor spoilers.This is not the film I expected after the last Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). If you missed ""Ant-man and the Wasp"" that has an important tie-in. Brie Larson was in the film far less than expected. When you have so many Avengers on the screen at one time, it is hard for anyone to get a major part.After they did the Blues Brothers, we are getting the band back routine, they did a very awkward ""Back to the Future"" movie that did not work as well as planned. I expected Nebula would trick Thanos and get some stones followed by the mother of all battles led by Captain Marvel. They didn't make that film.The production had some good laugh lines and some hold back the tears moments. Not to give away too much, but it was rumored some stars didn't want to do the series anymore. They were given a Captain Kirk exit.And yes, there is, of course, the mother of all Avenger's battle which will be hard to top.Stan Lee as a driver."
"OK So 3-Hours is Not Little Time for a Movie.But with a Universe so Vast and Varied with Characters and More Characters Interacting and Interweaving among Various Plot-Lines and Adventures,3-Hours can Barely Contain Any Kind of Finality that is Completely Satisfying.But the MCU (Marvel Comics Universe) has been Leading Audiences to this Point Through Over 20 Movies.So it had to Wrap-Up at some Point. So They Could Reboot and Start All Over Again.The Production Crew did an Entertaining Job of Touching on the Major Characters with Touching Tributes and Insights.The Plot Utilizes Time-Travel, and that is Always going to be Touchy.So, with All Time-Machine Movies it's Best to just Let Real Science Alone and Focus on the Fiction of Science-Fiction.It's a Sentimental Movie. After All it is the End of a Long-Lived Life of these Superheroes and Endings do Tend to be Emotional.The Action has its Thrills and Spills in the First Two ActsCombined with a lot of Exploration of the Past.There is Certainly a Big-Bang for the Buck.But the Action in the Third-Act is one of those Battle-Royals where the Screen is Filled form Left to Right, Top to Bottom with Characters and Machines.All in Hyper-Motion and Tasks the Eye and the Brain to the Limit of Human Perception.This can be Exhausting, Incomprehensible, and Tiresome.Just Trying to Take-In any of what is Happening On-Screen.Let Alone Investing in the Power of the Presentation.It can be a Bit Much, even for Fan-Boys."
"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny ""The Dude"" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like ""I don't like how she looks"". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes."
"Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos?
What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play?
Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life?
Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space?
Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'."
"I haven't heard more people upset about spoilers since the Star Wars prequels, so please consider this sentence the spoiler space you very well may need if you don't want to learn more. Then again, I'm going to discuss the idea of this film more than the actual movie itself.Avengers: Endgame is the blockbuster of 2019. It's a juggernaut that has the biggest cast of any superhero film ever, wrapping up almost 12 years of storyline and multiple movies, all to answer the question that came up at the end of Avengers: Infinity War: after you kill half of everything, what happens next?There's been a lot of soapboxing and online hand wringing about this film. Plenty of people feel the need to show that they're above the paltry populace, happy to proclaim their intellectual superiority and state that comic book related films demand that adults remain stuck in the days of adolescence. Much like the issues of today's politics, I'm not going to change anyone's mind that feels that way. All that ends up is two people shouting their talking points and refusing to learn anything from one another. But my snide comment is this: can't you just leave well enough alone?This is a popcorn movie that appeals to the biggest audience ever. And that's fine. You can ignore it if you like - we've never lived in a time where there's more opportunity to enjoy the media that you want. Me, I ignore mumblecore, critic beloved films and Oscar-bait movies for the most part. And that is also fine.All that I know is that I've seen nearly every Marvel film with the same set of guys that I've seen movies with since I was 25 or so. Each movie is an event where we get the chance to grab a meal, catch up and enjoy one another's company in the midst of our exceedingly stressful and busy lives. If a movie can do that, it's already a success before you even watch one frame. Movies bring us together, a light on the cave wall where we can hear a fantastic tale that's bigger than us. That's what this movie is - modern mythology of larger than life heroes who are the best of all of us battling the worst villains possible.Spoiler warning part two - here's where I get into major plot points. You've been warned.More than the overall tale, I enjoyed the story beats here. Hawkeye becoming Ronin, enraged that evil survived the purge while his family did not. The main sacrifice of this film isn't Black Widow's, but his. He was the first person who saw her as more than a killing machine and gave her a chance at life. Now, she repays the favor, taking him from killing machine back to family man. However, he must sacrifice their friendship and the knowledge that her loss will always be in the background when measured against the perceived greater loss of Iron Man.But hey - I've always loved the background characters more than the heavy hitters.There are moments here that really portray what the three main Avengers have had to give up to protect us. Iron Man must lose the stability and family he never knew he needed. Captain America's longing for Agent Carter, trapped by a glass wall that may as well be decades and not inches thick. Thor's descent into depression as he realizes that he couldn't save the day. Their fates each show them finally achieving the final part of their hero's journey save Thor, who is fated to repeat his journey over and over throughout rebirth after rebirth, even after Ragnarok, the end of all things.Those small moments mean more than the big explosions and special effects throughout this film. Tony's quick hug with his unsuspecting father. Thor's moment with his mother, who sees right through his deceptions. Even Quill's way too brief reunion with Gamora. The heart behind each charcter is why we care. There are hundreds of superpowered characters on the screen. The fact that we know the minute motivations of more than one of them is a credit to this tale.I love that this film both wraps up and begins new stories at its close. Sam Wilson must become Captain America, finally receiving the approval and friendship of the Winter Soldier. Thor realizes that his role is to be an adventurer, not the king, and gives the ownership of Asgard to Valkyrie. Even Steve Rogers realizes that despite becoming a grief counselor and telling people to live the new life they've been given, when the opportunity arises to return to his life, it's one he should embrace.Speaking of Rogers, I haven't heard an audience start cheering in the theater for a long time. The fact that he's able to lift Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, was not lost on this audience. Before, he was able to budge it. Now, his journey has made him truly worthy to lead the forces against Thanos, even if he appears alone at the seeming conclusion of the final battle.I also like the synchronicity that the first words that kicked off the Marvel cinematic universe were Tony Stark saying, ""I am Iron Man,"" which are also his last words. There's just something poetic about that.Hey look - I was happy that Crossbones got a few seconds of screentime. I'm that kind of geek. And if that fact upsets you, I'm never going to convince you that this is a good movie."
"Guy Ritchie is after Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers one of my favorite directors. With sublime movies like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and The Gentlemen, he's one of those directors you follow and are curious and excited about when a new movie comes out. But not all his movies are of the same quality. Like Sherlock Holmes for example (which I found mediocre) Wrath of Man is just passable. It's all well directed but the quality is just not there. And it's a movie with Jason Statham, so it speaks for itself what you will get. Statham never laughs, Statham can't be beaten, Statham wants revenge, in short Statham plays the same character every time. A bit like Liam Neeson. I don't say those are bad actors, certainly not, but it's just always the same. Wrath of Man is full of mindless action, a lot of dead people, a lot of questionable scenes (like the heist for example that looked like doomed to fail). I watched the movie trying not to yawn, I was hoping to get those great dialogues Guy Ritchie is known for, but that just never happened. Wrath of Man is just okay to watch once, but that's it, certainly not at the same level as the other movies from Guy Ritchie."

"Well, wow. Just wow. Guy Ritchie does it again.I have to say that if you enjoy movies from director Guy Ritchie or enjoy movies that has Jason Statham on the cast list, then you definitely have to sit down to watch the 2021 action crime thriller ""Wrath of Man"". This movie was through the roof.The title of the movie, though, was something that sort of gave off a biblical vibe, so I personally didn't think it was a title suitable for this particular movie.The storyline, as written by Guy Ritchie, was one that swept me up from the very beginning and took me along on a very exciting thrill ride. And I do like the fact that the movie wasn't all that linear and predictable. Writer and director Guy Ritchie managed to come up with something that is every bit as much action packed as it is intense. And that made for a very enjoyable movie.""Wrath of Man"" has a rather impressive cast ensemble, with the likes of Jason Statham, Holt McCallany, Josh Hartnett, Jeffrey Donovan, Scott Eastwood and Andy Garcia, along with others that were also nicely cast. I must say that Jason Statham was really good in this movie. But I was very thrilled with the performance that Scott Eastwood put on, he was just phenomenal in ""Wrath of Man"".And the character gallery in ""Wrath of Man"" was quite well written, and there were some very interesting and nicely detailed characters throughout the movie.This movie provided me with genuine entertainment from the very beginning and up to the very end. So this is indeed a movie that I can - and will - warmly recommend you sit down to watch, should you find yourself presented with the opportunity to do so.My rating of ""Wrath of Man"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars."
"Confusing yes, but good, confusingly good that is. Jason statham rides the plane like the boss of the aces high, its grumpy dirty, bloody and revengeful. One thing is for sure, this sand bank is just for the one who saw it first, so go to bed or your dead.Framing each other on multipel levels is an understatement in this armored value truckin robbin business, so keep your gobs strait, dont flip them out for cleansing cause they might get stolen. So , this is a solid criminal gold nugget, no wonder they kept it reserved for the big screen for quite a while. Its a recommend from the grumpy old man."

"I'm not ashamed to admit that I sort of like the late-teen genre. Yes it is a genre. Mean Girls, Easy A, Bring It On, Pitch Perfect...movies like that. They are sort of what John Hughes' films morphed into in the new Millennium. But I feel like it has been awhile since we had one like this. It definitely hits all the right notes and follows the genre specific recipe to make it entertaining. Its a little bit dirty and silly with over the top stereotypical high school clique roles. It isn't quite as fun as classics like Mean Girls or Ten Things I Hate About You and I can't see it being as memorable either but it definitely works and aims itself appropriately at the demographic. If there is a moral here, its a pretty shallow moral but that's not the point. Its a comedy at heart with a little romance and friendship. Perhaps the only thing that feels a little ridiculous is the film captures the spirit of Beverly Hills 90210 by casting nearly thirty year old high school students. They play their roles well and they looked proper age to me but I'm not a High Schooler. The cast is an interesting mix of potential up and comers regardless.Mae Whitman gets her first real starring role in a film. She was also good in the TV Series Parenthood but she actually proved she could do this. She wasn't quite as charismatic as an A-Lister (Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway even Lindsay Lohan in her prime) but she is down to earth and someone you can relate to and that might be more important for this particular movie. Bella Thorne who is a real up and comer as far as I'm concerned plays the hideously mean Madison. Thorne is a natural at sarcastic comedy, she was awesome in Blended, and she plays this part perfectly and is a great nemesis for Whitman. Robbie Amell plays Whitman's boy next door who is going to help turn her into a swan ala She's All That. Amell and Whitman have great chemistry, you really feel like they are childhood friends and they are the backbone of the movie. Bianca A. Santos and Skyler Samuels are okay as Whitman's best friends. They don't really get a lot of scenes and certainly not much in the character department but they are good.Ari Sandel is fairly new to the directing game but he definitely shows some talent in this genre. He has enough experience in comedy but he also is really making an effort to focus on the story here and I have to respect that because comedy doesn't make the film watchable, the story does. It isn't your typical mainstream big budget teen flick. It feels a little more indie and stylish and definitely worth checking out. It doesn't necessarily stand out in the genre but I would absolutely watch it again and it showcases a lot of new talent and a fun film. 7.5/10"
"Bianca (Mae Whitman), Casey (Bianca A. Santos) and Jess (Skyler Samuels) are three BFFs. Bianca is the smart one and at 14 minutes into the film she realizes she is a ""DUFF"" (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) which is certainly better than being a BUFF (Big Ugly Fat F@#$) although she doesn't like the role even though she is neither fat or ugly.This changes Bianca's perspective on life, school, social standings, and her best friends. Bianca wants to go out with Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman) a boy who plays a guitar and has bangs. She gets the help of her childhood friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), the high school jock who dates the hottest girl in the school (Bella Thorne) . Wesley needs help with chemistry which gives us the predictable formula results including the climax speech.The film is predictable from the title. It is teen oriented. DUFFs should love it.Guide: No real sex or nudity. Mom spouts an F-bomb near the end."
"There are films which are not suitable for all age groups and The DUFF is one perfect example.The base is set about a clumsy teen (Whitman) who thinks she is lucky to have two hotties (Santos & Samuels) as her friends in college. When she comes to know, from a good friend (Amell), that she is, in fact, designated an ugly and fat friend (abbrev. DUFF) of the group, she begins introspecting and changing her ways.You will detect how the story is outlined and if you are smart, chances are that you will see where and how the story is going to that cliché reservoir where all such films (read teen comedies) go. The preachy topic of being yourself when it comes to bullies at college, especially at this age of viral videos, is expressive, mostly because it is said with a tinge of humor.Although, one will understand that the plot keeps its distance from the reality, where in the school the teachers are the weirder ones. The soundtrack is complementing and so is the colorful setup. All said and done, the highly predictive climax just makes the whole film look like it dug its own grave with its own teeth.BOTTOM LINE: The DUFF is an effortless affair with doses of good comedy that will crack you up, even if you are not between 12 and 18 years of age, the group to whom it is actually intended.VERDICT: Below Average.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOVulgarity/Profanity: Mediocre"
"This film tells the story of a teenage girl who isn't as beautiful as her best friends. She is called a designated ugly fat friend, and her quest to change herself is started.I love high school movies, because they are always fun to watch. In ""The DUFF"", the plot is predictable but is very funny. I laughed out loud so many times, especially the scene where Bianca goes on a date with Toby. The scene outside the library about unfriending each other us hilarious as well, but i cab totally see it happening in real life. The positive message within the film is prominent and infectious, and it makes me feel more positive and happy! I really enjoyed watching this film."

"Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come."
"Christopher Nolan seems to have this penchant for making challenging cerebral movies that force you to pay attention. This one borrows elements from at least thee of his prior films that come to mind - 2000's ""Memento"", with it's perpetual rewind button; 2010's ""Inception"" that focuses on an alternate reality; and 2014's ""Interstellar"" with it's time travel anomaly. I generally rate his films highly here on IMDb even if I don't quite get what he's trying to accomplish, primarily for the stunning visuals and the clever creativity. With ""Tenet"", we have a protagonist who quite coincidentally goes by the description 'Protagonist' (John David Washington), who's recruited for a 'save the world' mission that requires stopping a single individual who's death would bring about the end of the planet. That facet of the picture isn't really explained very well, unless you want to give some credibility to the idea of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission, in which case it might make perfect sense.At least Nolan created a cinematic universe in which he brings back the idea that one shouldn't come across one's self in the past or the future, a concept that was stood on it's head in ""Back to the Future"". When I was a kid watching sci-fi flicks and TV shows, running into yourself in another reality was a recipe for disaster that was pretty much cast in concrete. Maybe some day the concept might get tested for real, but that's probably a long way off. In the meantime, just go through your old photo albums.The coolest thing about this picture were the handful of scenes where the time loop ran backwards and you encountered the forward moving protagonists running counter to just about everything else around them. Notwithstanding the 'grandfather paradox', one thing that the film makers could have done would have been to utilize a bitemporal response effect to construct additional sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter, thereby locking in the space/time anomaly in a temporal pincer movement. Then, by inverting an object's entropy, you could have had a multi-dimensional acceleration of events resulting in a future unhampered by the past. Feel free to pass the idea along to Mr. Nolan."
"I have seen this film twice now - once on an IMAX and once on a smaller screen to try and get the most from it - and I have to admit it's just nothing special. John David Washington - manscaped to within an inch of his life - is the ""Protagonist"" - a man who can manipulate time and who is recruited to work with ""Neil"" (Robert Pattinson) to track down a device that could destroy the world. His task is made much the harder because the future seems to be the source of much of the danger as he tries to track down and thwart Russian oligarch ""Andrei Sator"" (Sir Kenneth Branagh). Aside from plenty of action and some really clever special effects, that's about the height of it. JDW is adequate in the lead, but Pattinson is about as convincing as a rubber spider and Sir Kenneth's accent is so thick as to remind me of Cate Blanchett's dodgy wubble-ewes from ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). The star, for me at any rate, is Elizabeth Debicki as the trophy-wife who has an agenda of her own to escape the clutches of her megalomaniac husband, with her son - and so becomes an obvious ally on their quest. The plot is oddly straightforward, it's pretty obvious from the outset whom he can/cannot trust and once the faux-complexities of the story have been laid bare, the rest of the film is just a pretty routine spy drama that looks great - car chases, glamorous scenery etc - but is surely just a superb acclamation of hype over content. Certainly worth watching - and I'd say more than once, but it is by no means the best work from this visionary director ."

This is a great zombie film because it has got clear portrayals of the good and the bad sides of humanity. I enjoyed it a lot.
"TRAIN TO BUSAN (2016) **** Yoo Gong, Yu-mi Jung, Dong-seok Ma, Su-an Kim, Eui-sung Kim, Woo-sik Choi, Sohee, Soo-jung Ye, Myung-shin Park, Gwi-hwa Choi. Relentless zombie horror film from Korean filmmaker Sang-ho Yeon (who co-scripted with Joo-Suk Park) where an outbreak occurs while a train is en route from Seoul to the titular town with an atypical cast of characters (harried father with daughter in tow; pregnant woman; baseball team; dickhead CEO) that is given flesh and blood turns by its talented cast (you root for everyone amidst the horrific carnage unfolding). The claustrophobia mixed with sudden dread is altogether palpable and incredibly poignant."

"""Seok-woo"" (Yoo Gong) is a fund manager who spends all of his time at the office which has subsequently damaged his marriage beyond repair. As luck would have it, however, he happens to have his young daughter ""Soo-an"" (Su-an Kim) with him for a few days and to cheer her up agrees to accompany her on the morning train from Seoul to Busan to be with her mother. However, upon boarding the train they discover that a zombie apocalypse has just started in Korea and that they are trapped inside one of the passenger cars with no ability to escape. As a result the uninfected passengers are forced to band together to keep the determined zombies as bay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly solid zombie film which emphasized the ultra-fast variety in lieu of the typical slow-moving type. Because of that the action is quite brisk which initially worked quite well for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, I must admit that the non-stop action tended to become somewhat tedious after a while. Likewise, the rather poor ending didn't exactly help in that regard either. In any case, as I stated earlier this was a decent zombie movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average."
Relentlessly tense and intense zombie movie that is really quite exhausting to watch. If only it was 15 minutes shorter it would be a 10 star movie.
