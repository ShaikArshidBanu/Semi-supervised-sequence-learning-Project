"It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no ""Diamonds are Forever."" And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn't they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"""No Time to Die"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch James Bond living as a pensioner but this will change very soon. Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Léa Seydoux's who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek's who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes' who played as M. In conclusion, I have to say that ""No Time to Die"" is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of James Bond movies I am sure you will love it."
"Producers will blame the poor box office of ""No Time to Die"" on COVID but that's not why it's bombing. The movie is failing because there is no audience for it. It certainly wasn't made for fans of the Bond films (like me). The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn't that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn't a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn't have even noticed the jokes. It's also about twenty minutes too long. ""No Time to Die"" bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig's not-so-hot tenure as James Bond."
"NO TIME TO DIE (2021) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, Billy Magnussen, Christsoph Waltz, David Dencik, Ana de Armas, Dali Benssalah. Craig's swan song as 007 delivers all the goods with his brute force tactics and surprising vulnerability are on tap when his services are requested after 5 years retirement to stop baddie Lyutsifer Safin (silky Malek) from infiltrating a deadly nanobot virus via DNA into the world populace while also nursing his love for Seydoux who is in the mix in oh so many ways. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (who collaborated on the screenplay with Nal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) infuses death-defying set pieces with visual flair to spare (best viewed in Imax) as well as some much needed dry wit and humor."

30 minutes in and you realize that you do not care about either the main character or the problem he is trying to solve. Jake does his best but that is not enough.
"The Guilty fails to come together, with a weak and empty story.Gyllenhaal no doubt commands the screen, but if you want to do a film about police brutality... Do a film about police brutality."
"Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a policeman awaiting trial or a hearing and has been placed on 911 duty in LA. We see him handle the first few calls where he appears to blame the victim. He is also stressed by his separated family life. He gets a call from Emily who is stressed and claims she is abducted. He does everything he can to save here and her family. Then comes the devilish twist.I have discovered I like Jake Gyllenhaal films more when I have no idea what is going on with the plot. This was basically a one man play. Jake does a convincing job, I just didn't get into it.Guide: f-word. No sex or nudity. I really thought the LA 911 call center would be more busy and how does one keep getting the same 911 operator from a different cell tower?"
"It's certainly engaging, especially for a film that never leaves the one location of an emergency call center, & Gyllenhaal gives his all. I just wish the plot wasn't so ham-fisted, melodramatic, & oddly unnatural. How would someone this volatile get to keep this job? Of course, maybe that's the point; the privilege of white men is dangerously potent. Still, that message works better if the storytelling convinces us of that point instead of assuming we'll just blindly agree with it."
"This film start with the news broadcasting about the fire, and the introduction of the main character ""Joe"" scene! As turnout, this film is about a police officer with murder record ""Joe"" need to act as a call operator to save a psychopathic woman ""Emily""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the shouting scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the using asthma spray scene, overuse of the watching map on the screen scene, overuse of the talking on the microphone scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, and overuse of the recording by writing scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after Joe solve Emily case, he talking about his court case at the bathroom! That's it! Completely wasting time to watch!"
"Woody Harrelson (Carnage) brings nothing to anything, just his annoying personality. Perfect tool for Carnage. It is all about Woody Harrelson being Woody Harrelson. If you have seen him ranting in Zombieland and the sequel, you know what I mean.Tom Hardy (Venom) has to be the most over-rated actor in the history of cinema. He looks like some kind of klutz, Deputy Doofy from the Scare movies, a mental defective carrying around a psychotic sociopathic parasite that wants to be a comedian. Just the most bizzarro crud you can ever imagine. This is like the modern Abbott & Costello of third-string Marvel Superheroes.Perhaps the most blatant point that everyone ignores is that there is no SPIDER-MAN in the Venom movies. Spider-man is the arch-nemesis of both Venom and Carnage. There are literally hundreds of comic books about Venom or Carnage or both of them fighting Spider-Man. Dozens of trade paperbacks. So how do you do a series of Venom/Carnage movies without Spider-Man? WTF??? How lame is that?"
"So after watching the original Venom in 2018, I found it to be pretty good & enjoyable! This sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, which was meant to be released last year, finally comes & to be honest it wasn't bad!The film follows Eddie Brock & his new buddy companion Venom as he tries to navigate life with him! But when a super villain also gets a new buddy companion called Carnage, polar opposite to what Eddie Brock has does it get real & it's up to Eddie Brock & Venom to stop him & his girlfriend with super screaming powers!I found the film to be pretty good! It's not amazing by any means but it's enjoyable, fast paced & action packed! It has a decent runtime of 1 hour & 25 minutes, 1 hour & 30 minutes if you count the post credits scene! But yeah, the film was good with a decent story & decent characters, it was also quite funny & humourous in a couple of areas!Overall, it's a decent sequel, while not quite as good as the first film, it's definitely worth a watch & is a good watch with great graphics, epic action & decent enough story!7/10."
"Denis Villeneuve's Dune is not a perfection because it's still a preparation, a very very well made preparation, a perfect build for what i hope is gonna be a massive and incredible war, more incredible than the original 1984 Dune, Denis Villeneuve's Dune also fills with an amazing performance by all the cast, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is for me something special because the movie can keep me personally awake for 2 hours and 35 minutes and for a preparation movie with a very little big action scene it's very impressive, compare to Avengers Infinity War (which is another preparation movie to Avengers Endgame), Denis Villeneuve's Dune is mostly talking and it's work, is it better than the original Dune? Well, that's a joke for me because even the first 10 minutes of the film is already better than the original and the whole movie completely is not finish, overall, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is an incredibly well made remake yet not finish but it's worth to watch and worth to wait."
"The visuals are sometimes stunning but there are great issues with this ""version"": the changes in characters just feel very wrong - if you know or are used to the original material (I read Frank Herbert's books quite a few times, and Lynch's Dune is in my opinion, despite some flaws, a masterpiece and ways stronger than this new work, even the cinematography is in my view more original and fantastic, not to mention the way stronger and more interesting cast).Villeneuve's Dune may be a modern reinterpretation of the material and will maybe satisfy a younger audience or people who do not know the books (well), but for me it is more or less just a visual spectacle (like so many movies these days) with some profound changes (to characters, plot etc.) but without the right heart, mind and soul, and the greatest issue: a lot of the complex source material just gets lost in some sci-fi visual spectacle. Verdict: certainly not bad but rather mediocre pop-corn cinema stuff, because missing the depth of Herbert's fantastic epic sadly by far, but for sure there are lot of worse ways to spend 2+ hours of your lifetime.By the way - that Imdb is flooded right from the beginning by fake reviews and countless max rates, tells a lot."
"This film is delightful to watch! It is fun, engaging and upbeat. The visuals are fantastic. I enjoyed it a lot."
4 out of 5 stars.Free Guy is a good action comedy film about a non player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who breaks away from his routine in a video game world. And tries to follow a girl played by Jodie Comer. Who has her own hidden agenda.Great plot. The film has a tone like Wreck it Ralph or Ready Player One. The film is a lot of fun. Has lots of big and loud action. And lots of fun humor that is driven by Ryan Reynolds.Great cast ensemble. The movie could have took more use of adding more soundtrack that could have worked. But has the bare minimum. The movie does have a lot of fun cameos which is funny. And other references to other franchises. Which made the movie great.
"Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller and Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) is his best friend. He's actually an NPC (non-player character) in Free City, an online video game. He goes through every day doing the same thing and getting robbed multiple times. One day, he spots Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer) and his world view expands. In the real world, she is Millie suing Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing her code. She is in the game trying to find proof of that theft.It's a good idea but it's Ryan Reynolds who makes this good. He is the fun guy. He makes this fun. I do have a couple of problems with the movie. The security guy at the secret stash should be an NPC. At that point in the story, he should start convincing the other NPCs to help him outside of their programming. Also, there's no reason why the evidence is stashed in a room in the game. I get that it makes it easier but it makes no sense. All that is a little besides the point, it's Reynolds and he's the fun guy."
"Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson) must deal with a villain from her past and her long-absent family.LOUD, confusing and far too long. It starts off OK but quickly falls apart and becomes confusing and convoluted. The film is also way too long--it doesn't need to run over 2 hours. There's also tons of CGI at the end--way too much. The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie."
"I quite enjoyed this. I like the Scarlett Johansson ""Romanoff"" character from the MCU, and together here with Florence Pugh (Ok, so ""Yelena Belova"" sounds like one of Ian Fleming's innuendo-ridden Bond girls) the two have a blast tracking down the evil ""General Dreykov"" (a terribly wooden Ray Winstone) whom, it seems, has been masterminding some super-power laden sleeper cells in the US of A for quite some while now. It is only when their parents - David Harbour and an oddly miscast Rachel Weisz are rumbled and they all have to flee to Cuba that we discover the modern-day machinations of our evil baddie and when the sisters reunite after an absence that is never really explained - baddies beware. Like so many of the Marvel films, it's escapist nonsense - it's not there to challenge our views, beliefs or our politics, it's a very well produced vehicle for a star who gives her all each time and who may be many things here, but is never boring. The action scenes are plentiful, but they are not as frequent or as enduring as in many films of this nature, and though I will readily admit to finding it far too long, i did find it worthy of a big screen occasion - even if I will probably never watch it again."
"I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing. There are a few funny jokes to balance the film too. The scene with Florence Pugh posing made the cinema laughed out loud. I really enjoyed this film."
"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel."
"Have been anticipating this film since Halloween 2018 which I found to be a bit of a let down & lacking, but when I heard of this film, I was hoping for it to be better & boy did I get it!The film continues on the events from the last film directly & sees the whole town of Haddonfeild clubbing together to take down the monster Michael Myers for good!I found the film to be good, ok, not quite as gory, but still pretty damn close to it that's for sure! The violence was pretty epic for what it was & the scares were ace! Yes, there's no focus on a specific character, but hey who cares!? The story is simple also & straight forward, that's not an issue! Moreover is the fact that the film continues on directly after the film & sort clears uyp loose ends & back tracks to 1978 also which was good! The violence & body count are revved up in this sequel & put the 2018 film to shame! The eye candy is good also!Overall it's an ace sequel! Don't listen tot eh haters, watch it for yourself!9/10!"
"HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021) *** Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, James Jude Courtney, Nick Castle, Will Patton, Thomas Mann, Jim Cummings, Dylan Arnold, Robert Longstreet, Anthony Michael Hall, Charles Cyphers, Scott MacArthur, Michael McDonald, Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens. Filmmaker David Gordon Green (who re-unites on the screenplay with Scott Teems & Danny McBride) returns to the scene of the crime from HALLOWEEN (2018) where the attempted kill of Michael Myers by the long-suffering Laurie Strode (Curtis back in Mama Bear mode) fails to stick to the landing letting The Shape continue his bloody carnage of vengeance & homecoming, albeit amidst Haddonfield up-in-arms with a vigilante group let by Strode's former babysitting charge Tommy Doyle (Hall). While there are some impressively cool kills with so many annoying new characters to knock off, and a decent body count the film only suffers in very little for Curtis to do let alone have a moment with her sibling rivalry. Leaves the door wide open for the penultimate HALLOWEEN ENDS then."
"James Wan's name was suffice to pull me into seeing this. This movie has a solid n creepy twist with lots of gory mayhem n it has a nice pace.But the the foggy lair looked phony.Also the hospital on top of a hill and the parking of a car almost at the end of a fence less cliff is way too ridiculous.The chase scene was not at all required as it was unbelievable. Also a cop coming face to face with a killer and still not believing the existence of such a killer is again wtf.The sister of the lead female character walks in n outta a hospital n gets access to all the files and that too like a piece of cake.Wasn't it the job of the cops to get access to the files?They have kept it open for a sequel as aft so much mayhem n so many dead police officers, a particular character's fate needs to be seen.(Hiding the character's name to avoid spoilers).Whether that character will be thrown in a jail, or a psychiatric ward or an army research center.I thot i saw a fatter Zoe Bell lookalike but was surprised when i saw her name on imdb.Zoe Bell is totally wasted.She has indeed put on lottuva weight."
"Well just okay! Malignant starts out with a curiosity! What's going on here at the hospital? Then we have a women in a abusive relationship. There is many Wan movie scares of bumps, and creeks in the night. Malignant gets interesting, but suddenly turns into Jeepers Creepers. Predictable and lame was the ending. Watchable, but over the top like 80's horror movie. I found the music and shots was an 80 tribute. Like many 80's horror movie Malignant is b ish. Watchable but forgettable."

"In a research hospital in 1993, Dr. Florence Weaver faces a growing threat from Gabriel who seems to control electricity. She is forced to order ending him. In present day, a pregnant Madison Lake (Annabelle Wallis) is slammed against the wall by her angry husband. A mystery figure kills him and she wakes up in the hospital. Her supportive sister Sydney Lake (Maddie Hasson) tells her that she lost her baby. Police detectives Kekoa Shaw (George Young) and Regina Moss (Michole Briana White) investigate.James Wan comes home to horror. I like the backward facing killer. I don't find the mystery that compelling. More than anything, it's a bit confusing more than compelling. At the end of the day, I kept thinking that there is one easy solution... suicide. The movie never has the daring to approach that subject matter. It was always in her head and that's where the battle was going to be won or lost. The electricity is some odd X-Men addition that seems out of place. On the other hand, I do like the visual dreamscape transitions and the over-the-top action. It's crazy enough to work. There is a lot to admire from James Wan but ultimately, it feels a bit empty."
"Is the red hot case in this movie that i underestimated at all levels before viewing, if you search the wikipedia for relevant information on the true facts you will be impressed how the writers and directors have spun a trully develish endaring parapsychologic gory horror thriller story like taken outta the 1980's best ''thing''ishly made products.What i admire most of all is the use of enerving background music that makes your goosebumps scream '' dont turn your back to it'', and the mix of special effects and brilliantly made scene staging, the use of light and dark, sound effects and bloody gory physical fights that will linger your vegetative nerve system for all its worth and may shake your abundant teratomas back to life, like ripley said,''believe it or not.There are some black holes in the timeline of the story, and some intriscic factors that youll find hard to add up when watching, but i was simply overwhelmed by the scare factor that becomes so dominant all the way from the start.Acting is not the top notch on the hyperbel curvature, but still good enough to make you think ''ive got to see this one more time, at the cinema''. So if your in for shock and awe and a little bit of a mental freakshow, do as the grumpy old man did, view it . A big recommend and still searching for my teratoma."
"The story is interesting, but there's not enough suspense. There's something missing."
"I went into this movie blind, which definitely made my experience better. I had a good time. It has some cool ideas and concepts that make me think. I was into it throughout. And it has some very creepy and memorable scenes. I was debating between a 6 (good) and a 7 (awesome). Gave it a 6 for now, may change it to a 7 on second viewing (1 viewing, 7/26/2021)"
"A family is vacationing at a tropical paradise resort, better than Cancun. They are offered access to a special secluded beach, just for them and as it turns out a few other folks. Once on the beach, they are kept from leaving and they are aging rapidly. As it turns out someone in every family has an illness.I liked the concept as it was new to me. For the most part the beach scenes were chaos with no one knowing what was going on, including the audience. They needed to spend more time on the ending which was anti-climatic.Guide: 1 F-word. Implied sex. Near nudity."
"While Old starts out with an intriguing story, the idea gets fatigued quickly and the film becomes a little absent-minded. I appreciate that M. Night Shyamalan is trying to tell original stories, but the characters in this movie didn't act or speak like normal people. It took forever for them to realize what was going on, and then they suddenly leapt to all sorts of conclusions. I prefer Shyamalan's other geriatric thriller, The Visit."
"I have read several really bad reviews about this film, and the last film or two I watched from Shyamalan were average at best, but there was something about this film that I did enjoy.It flew by, it wasn't slow or dull, nor was it particularly scary, instead it relies on the primal fears many have (self included) about the ageing process, and the passing of time, if you are someone who has the slightest worry of time passing, this will resonate.The location work is awesome, and the production values are superb. Great acting throughout, it's always great to see Rufus Sewell's cheekbones.Not sure if it was my ears, but I found some of the dialogue a little muffled at times.All in all, this was good, 7/10."
"THE SUICIDE SQUAD (2021) *** 1/2 MARGOT ROBBIE, IDRIS ELBA, JOEL KINNAMON, JOHN CENA, DANIELA MELCHIOR (the voice of SYLVESTER STALLONE), DAVID DASTMALCHIAN, VIOLA DAVIS, MICHAEL ROOKER, NATHAN FILLION, PETE DAVIDSON, STEVE AGEE. Filmmaker James Gunn gets his ya-yas out in this go-for-broke kitchen sink epic taking of the cult DC Comics characters including in Robbie's hell-yeah Harley Quinn and Elba's morose Bloodsport forced to go on a secret mission with a melange of oddballs to thwart a worldwide threat in the form of an alien creature being housed as a military weapon in the fictional Corto Maltese. Totally bonkers and a ton of fun the ensemble motley crew is gonzo for destruction, mayhem and sure, saving the world at any means possible. King Shark is the wild card voiced by Sly as a man-eating cuddly great white in Jams.Have at it!"
"Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is back with the Suicide Squad. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) blackmails Bloodsport (Idris Elba) onto the team. Along with Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the group is tasked with infiltrating the island state of Corto Maltese after a military coup to take out an alien starfish.This is a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question."
"Ah the name puns. You gotta have them, right? The answer is obviously yes. So a bad or rather evil character as we know her ... or knew her? - is now back with an origin story. I have to admit, I have some issues with the movie overall or rather the morality is serves. Not to mention the kind of making away of what she becomes ... or making it ok, because of what happened to her.If you are able to leave those thoughts to the side and not be clouded by them, you may be able to enjoy this more. The story is quite straightforward - you have the evil Emma and the good Emma - which will become Evil. Sorry I can't just put this to the side. Obvious name choices to the side (and convenient happenings/accidents too), the actors do a fantastic job. The movie is quite dark for a family entertainment entry, but so was the 101 Dalmatians ... to a point.If you love those involved, you will get more out of it too. If you love dresses, you will have the time of your life - no pun intended."
"'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10."
"Okay so cruella was actually kind of amazing. The cinematography and costuming were breathtakingly beautiful. The storyline took a few weird turns, but for the most part really worked. The characters were well cast and well acted. The Emma's slayed being maniacally deranged."
"Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look, but it's not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of ""show, don't tell,"" by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence, as the soundtrack distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great, but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I don't mean to be cruel, but this unnecessary prequel is an overly long series of disjointed scenes."
Anyone who thinks that Fast and Furious has gotten way over the top with stunts and what not ... well wait til you see this. Just the beginning alone takes the cake ... not the car chase per se ... but the stunt out of that ... scene. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.I guess it sets the tone. And then we get Mark Wahlberg. Depending on how you feel about him ... you will love the rest of the movie or loathe it. I was ok with it ... he has some really interesting over the top scenes and stunts. Well his character does. Add to that some really good actors ... or funny ones ... and you have an intriguing if flawed movie. Could be worse ...
"""Infinites"" are people who have achieved a form of immortality through reincarnation. They have split into two groups in a battle of good versus evil. Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg) has always have knowledge beyond his experience. He forges a sword for a drug dealer in exchange for illegal meds to keep his sanity. He gets arrested and attacked by Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is saved by Nora Brightman who brings him into the world of the Infinites.This seems to have an intriguing elevator pitch. It's the story of reincarnation as a superhero movie. So the start seems fine. The drug dealer, the police station, and the epic escape are all fine. Once the movie starts doing expositions, it completely stalls. Wahlberg starts reverting back to his Wahlberg mannerisms. It's the blandest of action thrillers and the most bombastic. It takes any hint of original concept and turns it into forgettable non-descript action."
"I had low expectations for this movie, but it didn't even meet them. I suppose there were worse action movies out there, but just not worth the time."
"There should be a law that forbids Hollywood to maim European history, tales and legends. I am not talking about the main actor - The Green Knight has nothing to do (story-wise) with the great epics of medieval Europe but is one of those mass produced movies with some nice cinematography and effects but no real or good story. Like the last Arthur movie by Guy Ritchie (same procedure - take a well known character of literature or history but change everything else to your gusto), The Green Knight shows hard, that good story-writing is an craft and art that is not known and managed by many these days. Mediocrity hidden behind a veil of pseudo-intellectualism."
"At Christmas, the enigmatic Green Knight arrives at court and challenges all to fight him. If they strike him down they must agree to come to the green chapel a year later where they will receive the return blow. Dev Patel plays Gawain who volunteers to do this.Extremely beautiful, mystical and rather ambiguous take on the famous poem with Patel convincing as Gawain who spends the year on the quest to get to the green chapel. Not always easy to follow with all its often bizarre imagery, visions and flashbacks and who did what and why and what does that mean are questions that keep cropping up. It is engrossing though and captures the spirit of the time and the poem. Definitely not for those expecting an Arthurian adventure though."
"""The Green Knight"" is a Drama - Fantasy movie in which we watch the classic Arthurian legend ""The Green Knight"". Sir Gawain who is King Arthur's reckless nephew starts a quest in order to face the eponymous Green Knight but first he will witness some weird facts on his journey and he will evolve as a person and he will better define his character.I have to admit that I did know the legend of ""The Green Knight"" before watching this movie. The plot was very interesting but the way that was presented was not the best mainly due to its long duration. The interpretation of Dev Patel who played as Gawain was very good but the direction did not help him reveal his true potential. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarita Choudhury's who played as Mother, Sean Harris' who played as the King and Alicia Vikander's who played as Essel / The Lady. The direction which was made by David Lowery was not the best and I believe that he did not reach his potential and the movie's potential. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Green Knight"" is an average movie that failed to reach its high potential of becoming a great movie. Nevertheless, I recommend you to watch it because I believe that you will enjoy it but I suggest you to be patient with it."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Promising Young Woman"" (2020) is one of the most daring movies i've seen in some time. This movie kept me surprised during its whole 2 hours running time. I was surprised of how moviemaking was good as well as the story overall. Its a movie you won't forget soon after it will end. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to ""movie"" for me. I really liked it, but it wasn't like super realistic - maybe even more felt like fairytale.Overall, ""Promising Young Woman"" is a very good movie that sometimes was hard to watch due its premise. The more it revealed the more i felt for our main character. Here is a one movie you won't forget soon after seeing it."
"This was a pretty good movie but just didn't get there for me. I don't know if i'm more used to more extreme versions of this type of movie, but it seemed fairly tame. And for the most part, it was completely predictable from beginning to end. It was funny and charming but in the end i wasn't satisfied (1 viewing, 4/7/2021)SPOILERSi just couldn't buy into her dedicating her life to what amounts to making predators feel guilty so that hopefully they won't do it again. Maybe this is more realistic than a crazy revenge scheme that ruins ppls lives or even ends them. But realistic doesn't mean entertaining."
"""Fennell's execution puts her female identity at the forefront, not a masculine film masqueraded by a female director holding the rein, like Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCK (2008), PYW basks in many tropes from female-fronted genres, a combo of sororal slasher, silly romance (dancing to tunes of Paris Hilton's STARS ARE BLIND in a drug store, noughties pop gems is Fennell's blatant manifesto of girl power!) and oddball comedy (Cassie's birthday gift from her parents is a modish suitcase), with the appurtenances of Fennell's fabulous choices of decor and palette, it is a girlish-looking movie, but its thematics are grave, urgent, important and PYW makes a cogent case of it.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
"Let it be clear, Promising Young Woman is a good movie. Is it Oscar worthy? In my opinion it's not but that's just me. It's a revenge movie. The kind where you hope justice will be done, if possible with a lot of suffering for the guilty persons. I can't help it to be a bit disappointed in the revenge parts, but overal justice is served. Carey Mulligan did a very good job playing her character. And so did the rest of the cast. The movie is easy to follow, and even though the story is sad there are not really scenes that are too graphic. Maybe some more graphic scenes would have made this movie even better but again that's only my opinion. Promising Young Woman is certainly worth watching, some men could learn a lesson from it."
"CANDYMAN (2021) *** Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Colman Domingo, Kyle Kaminsky, Vanessa Williams, Brian King, Miriam Moss, Rebecca Spence, Michael Hargrove. (Cameos - Tony Todd & the voice of Virginia Madsen) Nia DaCosta's imaginative reboot of the 90s slasher flick updates the vengeance seeking demon with a Buppie couple (artist Abdul-Mateen & curator Parris) setting up shop in the bougie new confines of the mythical Cabrini-Green projects of Chicago where the urban legend of the titular spirit is resurrected when the painter begins to invoke the bogeyman for his own personal interests, unleashing a bloodletting as well as a nightmarish discovery. Executive produced by Jordan Peele - who co-wrote with DaCosta and Win Rosenfeld - the effective production design and atmospheric scoring by Rober Aiki Aubrey Lowe pairs incredibly with the handsomely shot cinematography of John Gulesarian employing effectively the dread building up ."
"Amateur night.The bad: this movie looks cheaply made and is cheap. Way below average acting performances, silly story, even sillier special effects, mediocre photography.Simply no thrill whatsoever.Not any good? I honestly cant think of any. It's not laughably bad, but it comes close...."
"Why do I do it, why do I always think that the number one choice is going to be good, it never is, and there's a good example of it here.Kate has 24 hours to get revenge on those that poisoned her, that's literally the plot, that start is followed by the most improbable, crazy fight sequences you will ever see.It goes on a bit, it looks pretty good, I loved the visuals, but that's the best element, the story is wafer thin, it lacks any sort of heart.Good acting, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is cracking, I am a big fan, sadly Woody isn't around for much, and that's a real shame.All in all, another disappointing film on Netflix, 5/10."
"Action scenes are well coreographed and there are interesting (although in a quite Orientalist spirit) sets. However, the predictable and full of clichés script seems to have been made by a machine. Music score is horrible. There are scenes (the car chase must be highlighted here) that seriously look like videogame. Indeed, so does the story. The sequence of important enemies looks like phases of a game. Too much money spent for a too unimportant and characterless movie."
"Again, totally blind into this Netflix just been told, watch it, it is good. And so it was.I just came back from Tokyo and it was shot in the district I stayed so I did recognized a few things, like the Godzilla head for example, And Lawson, and the sound of the red lights...memoriesKate is a pure revenge flick, exagerrated as there are so many at this moment. In fact, if you did like Nobody (2021) then you surely are going to like this one. And if you are into Yakuza and martial art, well, this is it.It's brutal, and bloody and messy. There's of course CGI, used for the car chase, also over the top but hey, it's so typical for these flicks.Kate is out there on flix, it's number 3 in my country so it does say a lot.Gore 1,5/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 2,5/5
Story 2,5/5
Comedy 0/5."
"Kate(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a hit women living in Tokyo, suddenly realizes that she was poisoned, and has 24 hrs to avenge it, and does not care how many bodies she has to step on to get to the person responsible, but will she before it's too late?Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a pretty good performance as tough hit woman with no mercy, but then shows she also be very vulnerable. The girl Kate teams up with is also great. Woody Harrelson brings his boyish charm as V, Kate's father figure boss. Kills are quite brutal, and fight scenes are quite intense. If you are into that, please give Kate a look."
"The crew once again comes together and saves the world. They had to create a past and make John Cena the brother of Vin Diesel and the bad guy. Jordana Brewster is back and Helen Mirren in a cameo. No Jason Stratham, but we do get Charlize Theron as the bad girl.The plot is immaterial. There is more car wreckage than what Bruce Willis did to Moscow. Roof top jumping becomes bus/truck top jumping. There is a scene which pokes fun at the FF series by discussing the infinite impossible missions that they go on and they don't die, or even get a scratch.And of course all ends well with the extended family meal.I learned you can drive through a mine field but you must be going 80 MPH or more. If you zig-zag when running away from someone shooting at you with an automatic weapon, you never get hit. Nobody know how to shoot out a tire. The Pontiac Fiero (plot spoiler) is rated for the icy vacuum of outer space. And Yoda was a puppet. Grab the popcorn, leave your mind at the door."
"And a dozen other productions, shamelessly. Just like civilization in 2021 -- total chaos."
The gang receives a transmission with Mr. Nobody. He had captured Cipher but the plane has crashed. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is reluctant to go on another mission and risk his family but Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) convinces him. There is a MacGuffin and Dom's newly revealed brother Jakob (John Cena). Family...The full title is Leprechaun 4: In Space. It's a bit of an insult to tag your movie In Space. Leprechaun is a campy horror-comedy franchise and its self-mocking humor uses the insult to its advantage. F&F has been approaching that line over the years and it may be a moment of jumping the shark. F&F started originally as a semi-serious fun cars & babes franchise. The action has gotten more and more ridiculous to the point of superhero unreality. Tyrese Gibson is doing a meta commentary while questioning his invulnerability. It's fitting that he and Ludacris are the ones going into space. Tyrese is the silly comic relief but it's getting out of hand. This series is being so ridiculous that it is almost critic-proof in that respect. No nay-sayer is going to win an argument by pointing out the outlandish non-sensical action scenes. We already know and it's why we watch the movies. It is what it is at this point.
"Seriously it was pretty obvious from the start that this had zero story and was basically a feeble attempt to pass a weak porn flick off into mainstream cinemasTo be honest 50 shades of Grey was a load of 💩 and this no different apart from the lead actor in this in my opinion was a lot better looking and sexier than the guy who played Christian Grey .If you want to watch some free harmless sex scenes then you may enjoy what this flick has to offer ,however if you want to be entertained intellectually then forget it! Almost forgot to mention the very annoying pop music played almost right the way through this but then again they needed something to fill the gaps in lack of script I guess!"
"In my life and this one comes pretty close to taking the cake. No story until the last minute, terrible acting, ""erotic"" scenes that made me laugh, weak dialog and in general hands down an awful show. Netflix must have got a huge discount on the purchase price or the director had a nocturnal emission when plotting the show. Scenery was nice though and a better actor than any of the cast. Chalk up a couple of wasted hours on Sunday afternoon. Lots of oral sex, if you're interested in that sort of thing but it was funny instead of erotic."
"... so far 502 (correction-503) have rated it 1.. and 223 a 10 ... 1-2 of all ten rating categories
... all need be said about it ... thank god for fast-forwarding
... all took little more than 15 minutes"
"This hardly qualifies as a film. It's basically porn with some random cringey lines and scenes stringed together. The actors can hardly even be called that and the direction is below amateur. The film essentially romanticizes kidnapping and rape too, and for that it should be ashamed. This is truly the bottom of the barrel for 2020."
"Rating it 3 not because of Rhea. I see so many reviews filled with hatred towards an accused and just because of that they have rated it 1, it's not even remotely related to the movie, sorry to see so many dumb Indians.Now to the movie, this is just dull and ridiculous. The characters start shady from the beginning, that just ruins any buildup towards a good thriller. They make it so obvious, that you can easily guess what's gonna happen.Despite a strong cast, actors don't have much to do because of a poor script.Just skip this movie. Waste of time."
"Calling this film boring would be an understatement. This film is a preachy, lethargic, crude and hollow thriller with neither style nor substance.I kept expecting something good to happen, and it never did. The plot is not good even for a short story, let alone a feature-length movie. The central mystery is really dull and it's presented in the most tedious way possible. Characters are uninteresting and the acting is flat. The monologue by Amit Ji is so preachy, stale and stupid that you really start to wonder about who wrote this crap. In my opinion, those self-righteous kooks, calling themselves protectors of law and justice, were equally at fault and should have been blamed for the casualty.This is waste of time and resources. There is no place for logic and reasoning in this film. The cinematography is good but visuals during the end sequences are reprehensible.The makers said during the release of the film that this is the film that is going to revive our theatres. If this is the kind of movie which is going to be made for theatres, let them be defunct."
"The movie has a great story director and cinematography but it is too much lengthy for court drama movie as always Amitabh sir's, Emraan Hashmis and everyone acted greatly."
"I tried, I really did! I hoped that the fairly decent, experienced, ensemble cast coupled with state of the art visual effects and a collection of modern-day pop lyrics would breathe new life into this timeless story. Well, sadly, that was all just a triumph for optimism over, well, just about anything... It's terrible. Good looking, well produced, but terrible. Am I the only person left alive who is fed up being shouted at by Edina Menzel? Pierce Brosnan demonstrated in ""Mamma Mia"" (2008) that he is happy to play parts with his tongue in his cheek, but here I fear he must have cringed when he saw; likewise Minnie Driver and a whole host of British comedians led by the ubiquitously un-talented James Corden. Billy Porter tries a different take on the fairy godmother character but features all to sparingly to make much impact on an otherwise extremely pedestrian interpretation that reached it's nadir with the cute but totally wooden pairing of Nicholas Galitzine (Freddie Mercury would spin in his grave) and Camila Cabello. Sorry, maybe if I were 6 years old and had nothing to compare this with, I'd not be so harsh - but I'm not and this is poor, really poor..."
"In summary my wife and I, grandparents, enjoyed this musical movie as light entertainment. It uses a lot of mostly contemporary songs that are actually sung by the cast. Most singing is pretty good, some of it not so much, but it does fine for this type of movie. It is mostly funny, at times absurd, with elaborate production numbers.The biggest divergence is both the prince and Ella are, in different ways, reluctant to accept the traditional roles. He isn't sure he really wants to follow his father as King, she isn't sure she wants to be a wife of a King, maybe being a dress designer would be more fulfilling.Right after release on Amazon streaming this movie has received lots of unjustified, very negative reviews. It isn't a bad movie, in fact it is very well made and interesting for any viewer in the right frame of mind. It isn't my type of movie, I'll probably not re-watch it, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. A rating of 5 or 6 is probably just about right."
"I had a good time watching Jungle Cruise because the thrills just keep on coming. As someone who likes adventures on reel, Jungle Cruise met all my lofty expectations: mythology and legend, a smart-aleck skipper, an Englishwoman and her sweet-faced brother, and the Amazon rainforest. Give it a go even if you are not familiar with the Disney link."
"So, some Pirates of the Caribbean, some Jumanji, some Mummy, some Lara Croft, some Indiana Jones. . . . But . . . I really had fun. Dwayne was Dwayne ;) I think the casting was good. I really enjoyed. Yes I agree, it wasn't a good movie but what did you expect? This is a popcorn movie.7 out of 10."
"I think this is quite a fun adventure. They repeatedly hinted at the guy's sexual orientation in the film, but it wasn't followed up in the end, which is a pity. Would have been nice if he got together with someone too."
"I had never heard of the Jungle Cruise ride until I heard of this movie, and that Disneyland was removing racist caricatures from the ride (well, they kinda have to at this point).As for the movie ""Jungle Cruise"", it was what I expected. Lots of action reminiscent of every adventure movie of the past forty years, and no shortage of CGI. Very much a summer movie. Sure to entertain the tykes."
"Well... if you know nothing about GI Joe, I guess it's good, except that Snake Eyes comes across as sort of an, well, an A-Word for most of the movie.And if you are a fan of GI Joe, this has nothing to do with Snake Eyes, the character isn't Snake Eyes, he's not even mute or horribly scared, and the movie absolutely sucks.But then, I guess if you are a fan of GI Joe, than you are toxic and the movie isn't made for you because it's made for the people who, I guess aren't GI Joe fans and is just reliant on the fans who it's not made for to make the box office returns that it didn't have because the fans who it's not made for are toxic for not seeing it.... or something like that.Anyway, it's not really a GI Joe movie, the character's aren't at all the same, and what you have is really sort of a bad kung-fu movie with choppy action, that doesn't even really work as a generic kung-fu movie because even that seems out of place and done in short and choppy motion that leaves the viewer kind of sea sick with no real idea who is doing what or what is going on when the fighting starts.So, I guess if you don't know anything about GI Joe, it might only be a bad movie and not an absolutely horrible movie."

"I saw this mainly cos of Iko Uwais n got terribly disappointed cos his footage is less n he doesnt get to kick ass.Then i thot lets just enjoy the action but then again none of the fight scenes are noteworthy.Recently i saw Lee's Fist of Fury n i loved the Japanese garden. This movie too has some some beautiful gardens, lakes, hill tops houses, etc.The editing ruined everything.Cos of the shaky cam n fast cut editing, one cannot make out what is going on during the fight scenes.The character of Snake Eyes is more spiteful n the character of Shadow Storm more sympathetic.How conveniently the clan n the Major Scarlett work together with Baroness, a Cobra member.Also how easily Snake Eyes forgives his dad's murderer n after that fight alongside Baroness inspite of knowing that Cobra gang gave the orders to eliminate his dad.I miss those old ninja movies man."
"There's a lot of action in the film, from guns to sword fights. There are times when the plot is not so convincing, such as when Akiko trusts snake eyes all of a sudden, or when snake eyes can fight with a sword skillfully on a motorcycle. It is nonetheless entertaining."
"Confusing yes, but good, confusingly good that is. Jason statham rides the plane like the boss of the aces high, its grumpy dirty, bloody and revengeful. One thing is for sure, this sand bank is just for the one who saw it first, so go to bed or your dead.Framing each other on multipel levels is an understatement in this armored value truckin robbin business, so keep your gobs strait, dont flip them out for cleansing cause they might get stolen. So , this is a solid criminal gold nugget, no wonder they kept it reserved for the big screen for quite a while. Its a recommend from the grumpy old man."
"If you want a good action movie, this is it. No bull, no complicated back stories, no pointless characters added for diversity, no mercy with any of the others. Except one scene towards the end that had no right being there, it was a damn good movie. And might I add that I thought Jason Statham played the same tough invulnerable unshakeable guy, but differently. He put a ton of stoic pain in the acting that improved this film a lot.And that's the whole review, because other than good action and movie making, there is nothing else there. Perfection is reached when there is nothing else to remove."
"""Wrath of Man"" had three strong ingredients: a solid central character, plenty of action, and an intricately crafted screenplay.Jason Statham is first-rate in the role the man known as ""H,"" which is short for Mr. Hill. His real name is Mr. Mace, but the names do not figure in the intensity of the action.The best scenes were those involving a fleet of private armored trucks of the Fortico Company. The opening sequence sets the stage for ""H"" infiltrating the company, landing a job as a security agent, and seeking revenge for the death of his son Dougie.The script effectively doubled back to reveal what happened to Dougie as a bystander during the film's opening scene. The bereaved dad stoically plots his revenge by piecing together clues about the perpetrators. Led by an operative known as ""Sarge"" and the trigger-happen Jan, the team, of course, is no match for ""H.""The secondary characters were well-developed, especially the operative named Bullett. The associate of ""H"" named Kristy could have been fleshed out more completely. But the film succeeded in delivering good location footage around L. A. and, above all, solid action around armored trucks and millions of dollars in cargo."
"Amazing storytelling jam packed with action. The cinematography was beautifully done, the way you're given different perspectives of the same scene, is so well done. The story unfolded in a captivating and compelling way. The acting was decent and the action coordination felt authentic."
The first question that came to mind was which Escape Room is the a sequel to? That is answered in the opening scenes as they replay part of the first feature. We are expected to know Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) from the first film. They are captured along with other champions who we don't know and are forced back into the game of frantic people screaming and attempting to figure out puzzles in a minute or so. I was not as impressed with this film as the original.Guide: No sex or nudity. Two softly spoken F-words.
"I saw ""Escape Room:Tournament of Champions"", starring Taylor Russell-Words on Bathroom Walls, Lost in Space_tv_2018; Logan Miller-The Walking Dead_tv, The Bling Ring; Deborah Ann Woll-The Punisher_tv, True Blood_tv and Lucy Newman_Williams-London Has Fallen, Everest.This is a sequel to the 2019 minor hit-it cost $9 million and made $150 million-so with numbers like that, there was bound to be a sequel. If you are missing the Saw movies, this should fill the gap. It puts people in escape rooms where they have to solve puzzles to get out and continue along to the next test. Taylor, Logan and Deborah are survivors from the first movie and get roped back into the games. Lucy is a therapist that Taylor is seeing-because of the events in the first movie-that is trying to get Taylor over her fears. Taylor & Logan get on a subway train and the games begin anew. They also find out that 4 other people on the train have been through the games before so that's why it's called the tournament of champions. The ending leaves room for a sequel-if they make big bucks.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.It's a little better than the first one with more elaborate traps-probably because of a bigger budget-but I don't think I would buy it on DVD. If you liked the first one, this would be a good rental."
Just a horrible movie that exists only to cash in on the prequel.The characters are horrible and the 'games' are mostly moronic.Avoid!

"This film start with a man ""Rob"" talking to his pig, and a people ""Amir"" arrive with his car scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of who kidnapped Rob's pig! We found out is Amir's father! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the calling names scene, and overuse of the preparing food scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after knowing his beloved pig already dead, Rob playing the cassette! That's it! Completely wasting time to watch!"
"Nicolas Cage (Robin) is electrifying in Pig much better than a lot of his oddball roles! I don't think it's much of a thriller except a few parts, more of a drama that is quite impactful on emotions and crystal smooth writing. I'm offended a couple people I talked to thought Pig was a name for someone no it's actually about the animal which was so well filmed in every aspect! I wasn't sure why people were so mean to Robin but he handled it all superbly. I absolutely loved this movie, I highly recommend it to anyone."
"After being delayed for a year because of the pandemic, this sequel to A Quiet Place finally came out. This marked the first time I went with my movie theatre-working friend to watch a movie in two years. Good thing we did because this was as thrilling and entertaining as the original one. John Krasinski is once again writer and director and appears in the beginning sequence which takes place before the first movie. And his wife Emily Blunt is also there and, along with the two players playing her teen children, make compelling performances throughout along with some other players that we haven't seen before in the original. I'll just now say we both highly recommend A Quiet Place Part II."
"Great horror flick, well-made all around. Doesn't miss a beat as a continuation of the story as well as the tone and feel. Intense and suspenseful with some major tension. An awesome opening scene. Overall very enjoyable.It's hard for me to say which one is better. I think overall they are about the same. But this one had some scenes that were way better and made me think it could surpass the original. But there are other things i didn't like as much and didn't feel as natural. The original was a steadier 7 star movie, although there were some questionable parts in that one as well. (1 viewing, 5/27/2021)"
"Now, as sequels go this is not half bad. Building on the well crafted 2018 film, we take the story of the ""Abbott"" family still in hiding from the deadly alien locust like creatures. Still grieving, mother ""Evelyn"" (Emily Blunt) must try to keep her remaining two children ""Regan"" (Millicent Simmonds) and ""Marcus"" (Noah Jupe) as well as their newly arrived baby out of the clutches of their nemeses. Forced to flee the relative safety of their home, they hook up with neighbour ""Emmett"" (Cillian Murphy) and attempt to reach safety on an island that the invaders (who cannot swim) have yet to conquer... This picks up well on the tension left at the end of the first film, the characters are already established so John Krasinksi doesn't have to waste time reimagining them. Aside from a slightly distracting recap demonstrating how their current predicament started, the feature moves along apace with plenty of tautly directed action that presents both of the younger actors with opportunities to shine - and that they do. Unlike many follow-ups, this expands the story giving us plenty to hide behind the sofa from; an extra character from Murphy that adds to the threat nicely, and though I didn't enjoy it quite so much as the original, it's still a fine piece of cinema."

"Don't Breathe 2 didn't need to happen but with the way the first ended I'm happy the story was continued. It's more grotesque, just as dark in tone if not even more so, the terror is so well done, cast is solid enough and entertainment value should be appreciated! I love these morbid wildly violent movies so much so that I want to own when available. Probably made it even better that Fede Alvarez was part of the crew since he directed the first one. Stephen Lang did so great as the blind man that has to deal with a new group of home invaders and a little girl he care-takes. Love or support my thoughts I highly recommend Don't Breathe 2 to horror fans!"
". . . would ever set foot in the U. S. ""city"" of Detroit. DON'T BREATHE 2 illustrates why someone walking down a Motor City sidewalk with a small cooler is more than likely a courier transporting a vital bodily organ stolen from a freshly-murdered corpse intended for a back alley transplant operation to be performed by a defrocked surgeon without the benefit of any anaesthesia, nurses, medical monitors or basic hygiene. This film recounts how arson has replaced baseball as Motown's main municipal pastime, given that most of the DFD personnel have quit in recent years due to the chronic lack of bath tissue at their stations. Detroit's police chiefs always are more interested in making personal gubernatorial runs than in solving homicides, so this blighted region perennially vies with Mexico for having the distinction of the lowest conviction rate for murderers in the known world. DON'T BREATHE 2 is not exaggerating a single bit as it depicts Detroit's chaotic mayhem and unbridled vicious violence. Take it from Mr. Hoffa: When there's a major crime in Detroit, the case is NEVER solved!"
"Despite myself, I actually rather enjoyed this. Certainly the plot is pretty far-fetched, but once the film gets up a head of steam, it is quickly paced with some well placed jump scenes that work quite well. Stephen Lang is effective as the blind fella, trying to rescue his ""daughter"" from her long-lost family, and is especially so once we find out just quite why they are so keen on re-uniting. Madelyn Grace is also quite competent as the young girl ""Phoenix"" and I found Fiona O'Shaughnessy's particularly odious ""mother"" character quite detestable too. Not great, no, but kills an hour and a half easily enough and reminds you to always honour your dog - or else!!"
"Don't Breathe 2 (2021) is a movie the wife and I caught in theatres last weekend. The storyline follows Norman Nordstrom as he lives isolated from a society that is falling apart. He protects his little girl and keeps her from local schools and hoodlums. Her curiosity puts his endeavors at risk. One day his little girl is seen in the city and a group of kidnappers follow her home. The kidnappers really don't know how challenging their task is gonna be. This movie is directed by Rodo Sayagues in his directorial debut and stars Stephen Lang (Avatar), Madelyn Grace (Grey's Anatomy), Brendan Sexton III (Boys Don't Cry), Rocci Williams (Wrath of Man) and Adam Young (Sex Education). The storyline and settings for this are way better than they should be. There's a subtle post apocalyptic feel to it with excellent violence and gore that reminded me of a slightly toned down Hobo with a Shotgun. The premise, once it's revealed, is crazy and over the top goodness. The movie starts with two fantastic kill scenes and hits the ground running. The final couple kills are cinematic gold. Loved the special effects and use of various props for their kill scenes. This is a horror fans dream movie that is an absolute must see. I'd score this an easy 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it."
"This is a sequel to the 2017 Wonder Woman, set during WW1 times. This one is 1984 and the new ""war"" is an individual or two trying to take control of the whole world. That is facilitated by an ancient crystal that magically grants wishes.It did not find this one as interesting and entertaining. So to distil it down, what is it about?There is an old John Denver song ""Poems, Prayers and Promises"" and part of the lyrics go like this:""Talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday and what about tomorrow?What about our dreams and all the memories we share?""And in a great sense that is what the movie is ultimately saying, find things to believe in rather than accentuate our differences. I found much of it interesting and entertaining, while I found some of it to be dull and uninteresting. It definitely isn't a ""1"" or a ""2"" but it also isn't better than about a ""6"" or a ""7"" when compared to other fantasy movies.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped."
"I did like Wonder Woman and here we have it, the blockbuster from the Covid-19 era, the number one. So happy it came out on Christmas and so happy they put it on streaming services to watch it over here because all theatres are closed.But what the hell was this? A great opening that's for sure and off we go to the story itself with Wonder Woman rescueing and catching some burglars in amall, all great but from there the story goes to, well, nothing at all. It do has a few moments that are great but what about the fireworks, really? The flying of Wonder Woman, takes ages. The end battle, before it starts, well well, not that good after all.Wtached it with my 13 year old daughter, she liked it very much (has seen Wonder Woman 3 times and has seen The Joker and Dark Knight) so she really is into superheroes, but for me it was just above mediocre, did like Barbara, the villain, seeing her transform from nothing to mention to what she became, that was okay.So they decided to make part 3, hopefully with some more fight scene's
Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 5/5
Story 2/5
Comedy 0/5"
"This movie has some really bad points. It isn't the worst action hero movie ever. It's 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.
Firstly the bad points:
1. The story. This silly ""wish"" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn't have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It's beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.
2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.
The good points:
1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.
2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.
3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.
4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.
The cast is good but they can't save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.
5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3."
"Following Batman v Superman, Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) are searching for more heroes for the upcoming battle against Steppenwolf. They recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and The Flash (Ezra Miller).Is this better? On a basic level, yes. It's not chopped up and corrupted by a different chef. It gives each hero more background. The scenes are not cut short. Even Steppenwolf looks better. It fits Zack Snyder's vision better in style and in color. This four hour extravaganza is Zack Snyder's definitive version. That is also why it wouldn't have been shown in theaters. My suggestion is to split it up in two but it's hard to place the break. The obvious story break is bringing Superman back to life but that happens well into the second half. Now that it's on HBO Max, one should probably split it up into a few sittings. It's a heavy lift, and I had several breaks over two nights. There is only so much overly crowded CGI and slow-motion pose-a-thon that I can take. Nevertheless, I still appreciate that it's his style. The tone is serious with Ezra Miller providing much of the humor. It's not the quip train from a Marvel movie. This is a war between Gods with all the good and the bad. The grandiose can be overdosing. It is very much Zack Snyder."
"While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films."
"If you haven't watched Nobody yet, do yourself a favour. Best movie I've seen in ages That's not my words it's someone else's but I totally vouch for him. He's never sold me a dud movie."
"Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is Nobody. He is a suburban family man doing his boring job in a non-eventful routine. One night, two masked people break into his home. His son tries to fight back but he puts a stop to it. He loses the respect of his son and others. Non of them knows about his secret violent past. When his daughter is missing a bracelet, it's the last straw and he tracks down the robbers. His path collides with a brutal Russian mobster.This is Jimmy trying to be John Wick. I don't think Odenkirk is the John Wick type. He's not quiet enough although he tries in the opening. He has a comedic energy that is vibrating to get out. The action is not quite as cool although there is plenty of it. I do not like the Home Alone booby-traps in the last part. Overall, it's an interesting attempt. I like it enough. It's good popcorn waster but it's unlikely to lead to a John Wick style franchise."
"If you get the idea for your movie from somewhere else and then you do a great film, you are an artist. What are you after you get the idea for your movie from at least three different beloved stories and still do a ridiculously bad film?That's the story of this piece of garbage which manages to mix around the ideas of Alien Earth War, The Thing and something like The Forever War or Old Man's War, gets Chris Pratt and J. K. Simmons in the cast and then takes all of that goodness and somehow manages to drive it into the ground via a latrine. The incompetence of the writer's staff for this film is astounding. Nothing makes sense in this film, I mean literally nothing.Bottom line: ignore this completely. The only worse film this year is Army of the Dead."
"""The Father"" is a contemporary example of what was formerly called ""Kitchen Sink Drama""--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, ""Who am I?""It wasn't entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne's ""husband"" would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait."
"After his previous carer leaves the daughter of an octogenarian, Anthony, organises a new carer for him. However, to Anthony everything is confusion: faces change, one day his daughter Anne is moving to Paris, the next day she's not, is this his flat or not? And why doesn't his other daughter visit him anymore?Brilliant. An absorbing, sensitive-yet-jarring look into what a person living with dementia or similar must go through plus what those that love them and care for them must experience. Told in a very intriguing and compelling manner: nothing is signposted, everything unfolds in a layered altered-reality fashion, making you figure things out for yourself.Quite haunting and thought-provoking, as that could be you one day, or someone you love. Incredibly emotional too as you think about this affects his loved ones, the life he's lived and that this is what it now amounts to.Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the lead role. While the plot and direction are fantastic the film needed an excellent performance as Anthony and that's what Hopkins does, absolutely nailing it. He well deserved his Best Actor Oscar.Great supporting cast: Olivia Colman (who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her efforts), Rufus Sewell, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Mark Gatiss."
"The devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease (although never mentioned by name) on an aged ex-engineer in London. There is no conventional story in ""The Father"", and that's as it should be. Director Florian Zeller, who also co-adapted his 2012 play ""Le Père"" with Christopher Hampton, gets inside the deteriorating mind of the central character with astonishing skill (although it takes about 15 minutes to get into the movie's rhythm). Anthony Hopkins gives an incredible performance; his confused, frustrated Anthony is delusional, forgetful, obsessed with time, unable to distinguish the past from the present, and prone to nostalgic bewilderment and angry fits of befuddlement. We, too, are lost in time as people Anthony is introduced to are either figments of his imagination or are substitutes for whomever is trying to communicate with him in the present. It's a moving journey through a trap-door existence, though the operatic pieces by composer Ludovico Einaudi are a tiny bit excruciating (less so if you admire the genre) and Zeller tends to overdose on weary-eyed closeups of Olivia Colman playing Anthony's conflicted daughter. Six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Hopkins as Best Actor. *** from ****"
"Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lives in his large London flat for much of his adult life. He's showing signs of dementia as he falsely accuses others of stealing his beloved watch. His caregiver daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) tells him that she's moving to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. His world is disjointed and confused as unfamiliar faces push into his life.It's a fascinating artistic vision of what dementia must feel like. When Olivia Williams shows up, I thought the movie could go in two interesting ways. The new people could be scamming the old man which would be very daring in terms of writing. It could also be a psychological Kafkaesque horror with ever-changing faces. The movie tries that but it's not pushing the Kafka feel enough. This is an interesting movie with some very interesting actors. Maybe the early part of the movie had me expecting too much. I end up reviewing what's not on the screen rather than what's on it."
"The problem with this is you haven't the faintest idea as to what the thing is about until so late in the day as to have long since even up... Hugh Jackman (""Nick"") runs a sort of laboratory with his pal Thandie Newton (""Watts"") that has a big bath into which folks can go an relive their memories for a few hundred bucks a pop. One day, the beautiful ""Mae"" (Rebecca Ferguson) arrives, into the bath she gets and poor old ""Nick"" is hooked... From here on in it's not quite clear whether we are in the past, the present or the future - was she real, is she real - is he, is any of it - and most importantly - do we give a monkeys? Sadly, his obsession wasn't mine - and I lost interest. There are some fun scenes - especially for fans of lethal fish, but for the most part it is a good looking but rather uninteresting story that gives us precious little context at any stage that might enable us to opt into his fixation. Nobody's best work."
This was one good Sci Fi Noir filled with some good acts and some good story potentials .Hugh was likeable while Rebecca was visual threat.
"...apart from the eventual moment where credits rolled, it's a decent watch, it just felt too long at times, and a bit repetitive.It's an interesting film, it's almost like a sci fi film noir, it has that moody, subdued atmosphere, and the appropriate dialogue, the contradiction comes with the water logged Cities and imaginative technology, an interesting contrast of styles.The trailers looked great, the film looks fantastic, but for me there was too much of a focus on the visuals, and not enough on the actual storytelling, which at times was a little drab. Visually though it's amazing, the futuristic world looks awesome, throw in Rebecca Ferguson's gorgeous presence and Jackman's muscles, and you have something for everyone.Imaginative, interesting, just a little too slow for me, it felt like a film hampered by restrictions, which of course it was. 6/10."
"In the near-future, Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) lives in a flooded Miami due to climate change. He and his assistant Emily 'Watts' Sanders (Thandiwe Newton) operate a machine for people to relive their best memories. Both are veterans of a devastating recent war. Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) walks in asking for help to find her keys and begins a relationship with Nick. She goes missing and Nick becomes haunted reliving his memories with her over and over again. The police hires him to get into a comatose suspect's memories where he discovers Mae working as a nightclub waitress. He starts investigating on his own and dives into a rabbit hole of mysteries.There is a lot to like in this near-future sci-fi noir. I like the style of it. I like Hugh Jackman. I like the idea of this concept but the concept actually imbeds a devious story landmine. It forces a lot of the action into flashbacks. The narrative becomes a labyrinthian mess. It strives for something interesting but fails to grasp it. Writer/director Lisa Joy seems to be trying to branch out on her own after her work on Westworld. She has something there but it needs work. The first thing I would work on is the title. It's trying to be Nolanesque without the self-confidence."
"I was expecting absolutely no plot, but we actually get a small one. It seems it's time for the Earthrealm fighters and Outworld fighters to square off. Outworld has won 9 times in a row and if wins again will take over Earth. So not only do the fighters have to save themselves, they must also save mankind. Sub zero beings to hunt down Cole, whose ancester was Scorpion. Jax and Sonya Blade hunt him down and tell him about the Mortal Kombat tournament. Sonya has captured Kano whom has the mark of the dragon like Cole and Jax. From there, they go to the temple of Raiden to seek training and learn their secret powers. Shang Tsung tries to cheat by engaging in combat before the tournament, so all our characters end up taking each other on. We get some good fights and gore( not very realistic) but still cool. Scorpion shows up at the end and breathes fire, cool. I think you need to know something about the video game and its characters to really enjoy this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the video game, I think you will like this. You can still enjoy the fights if you don't know much about the game. Worth a view."
"I normally have no interest in these films, but I find it entertaining and appealing."
I don't know what the deal is for a video game adaption this Mortal Kombat is the closet thing to accurate in my opinion. Got to see this in RPX which is an exhilarating theater experience glad I didn't watch on HBO it wouldn't have been as epic! I absolutely love how brutal the fights/murder scenes were. Some of my reviews don't get enough appreciation so at least take the positivity from me.
"This sort of feels like Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but not with the same quality. If Scott Pilgrim was a 10/10 this is not even close to being a 10/10.The Pros - Good soundtrack. Quirky characters, Good cast, Cinematography, The flashbacks and the way they seamlessly integrated them in to the movie, lesbian lover assassinsThe Cons - Plot (boring and predictable), Girls (all the girls are good) vs Guys (all the guys are bad), bad guy chewing on a match stick, Fight scenes (too many cuts), choreography of fight scenes, Misc - Limited deus ex machinaRight when I thought it was over, I had to deal with another 15 minutes? At least there was one gratuitous death of the 'good guys' in the end."
"Gunpowder Milkshake is beautiful, I crave the amazing cinematography and to top it off the action is awesomeness! Girl power movies are usually so damn good I'd say 65% of the time. The music is god tier throughout I really like it! Karen Gillian is perfect as a professional killer. I don't use Netflix as much as most but I wish I saw this sooner."
"Gunpowder Milkshake tries too hard to be a stylised female John Wick. It needed more inspiration instead of ripping off Hong Kong action movies.It also lacks the heavy duty gunfire of John Wick and the playfulness of Keanu Reeves.Sam (Karen Gillan) was abandoned by her hitwoman mother Scarlet (Lena Headey) some years earlier.The older Sam has followed in her mother's footstep by becoming an assassin for her boss Nathan (Paul Giamatti.)When a job goes wrong. Sam needs to look after a little girl and get help from three women who were her mother's comrades called the librariansThere are some nice touches such as the diner shootout. However the story is thin, the movie overlong and Michelle Yeoh is the real standout when it comes to action."
"""Fear Street: 1994"" is a Mystery - Horror movie and the first movie of the ""Fear Street"" franchise, in which we watch a group of teenage friends trying to solve a mystery behind a series of brutal murders that frighten Shadyside for more than 300 years.I enjoyed this movie because it had a very interesting and mysterious plot. The only think that I did not like were the unnecessary jump-scares but thankfully were very few so, they did not ruined the image of the movie. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak was very good and she presented her main characters very well along with their history. In addition to this, she did an excellent job on the way she connected the history of Shadyside with the present time. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Kiana Madeira who played as Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Kate, Olivia Scott Welch who played as Samantha Fraser and Fred Hechinger who played as Simon were very good and their combination as a team worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Fear Street: 1994"" is a nice horror movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of horror movies."
"I had never heard of the Fear Street books before watching this movie. What was particularly interesting was that, like ""Stranger Things"", ""Fear Street: 1994"" looks at the class differences. It's nothing great, but I did like it, and I'll be eager to see parts 2 and 3."
"A girl's boyfriend gets brutally stabbed to death in front of her but no reaction.The entire town, the mall, the hospital, the stadium, etc are almost all empty n no significant elder shown.A hospital without any doctors n security.A minority fella working in a mall is unnecessary handcuffed in a lockup inspite of the killer being shot dead.Except for two brutal deaths towards the end, the movie is devoid of terror, tension n suspense.The death sequence of Kate (Julia Rehwald) is gory n innovative.Let's see how the sequel will fare."
"Movie tries really hard to pull on some heartstrings wich may be a little offputting. But overall a very nice story with human aspects. Acting was ok, some slipups but overall good. Overall a fine movie with some really good story elements.7/10: yes."
"This film has it all. It is hilariously funny. I hadn't laugh this much all summer long and this film really help my brain release the endorphins. My ribs hurt from laughing. The film has a tremendous amount of heart. This was a tear jerker by the end. All of the characters are so lovable and reliable. Watching Frank Rossi describe how to put a condom on in sign language to Miles was just ...agghhh amazing.Director Sian Heder knocked it out of the park with extremely laser precision on-point direction. Specially how he had the actors who played Ruby's parents react to the singing at the high school. Everything was so on point and believable. Emilia Jones was outstanding. Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved. It was one after another, freaking fantastic scenes.The only con I can think of was the title. Why an acronym for such a beautiful film?SOLID 10/10 and screw the haters. This film really deserved the 10."
"Siân Heder's 'CODA' is a heartfelt crowd-pleaser that hits all the right notes. While the film utilises many familiar tricks, it is a picture with compelling performances from a great ensemble and boasts a well-crafted and well-executed genuinely uplifting story about family and people who care deeply about one another. An emotional powerhouse."
"The Courier is based on true events, the Cuban Missile Crisis to be more precise. It's an entertaining movie but don't expect too much action scenes as there are almost none. It's more a spy drama about an event that the whole world knows about. The cast did a good job playing their characters. I've never been a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch but I have to admit he can act. He just has one of those faces I don't really like but credits to him, he can act. The Courier is certainly worth a watch, especially if you like historical facts and spy movies about the Cold War."
"I feel the story was too slow without enough substance to fill up the 112 min runtime. The premise of the story just wasn't interesting enough to be that long, and it should've been sped up and trimmed down to no more than 80 min runtime. Casting and performances were great, and probably the main reason I didn't fall asleep. Considering it was put together by fairly newb filmmakers, I'm still giving it a generous 7/10."
"Ok, so I'm not sold on Benedict Cumberbatch - his acting gets less remarkable the more I see him on screen, and here he does little to enliven this Le Carré-lite spy drama. Based on a true story, it depicts the courageous escapades of Briton Greville Wynne who was co-opted by British Intelligence and the CIA into working with a Russian soldier based in Moscow, to help share secrets that might avert a nuclear war over the placing of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Insofar as it is a true story, it is interesting but I found the whole presentation of the thing rather dreary. Again, the factual elements of the story rob it of any jeopardy - we know what happened/happens and so it's the depiction of the risks taken, the genuine threats to those involved and the seriousness of their mission that should have made this compelling. Sadly, though, Dominc Cooke's film just never really gets out of third gear - and the supporting cast, including his opposite number in ""Penkovsky"" (Merab Ninidze) add very little to what is essentially a single hander for which, in my view, the star isn't up to holding together. It doesn't need a big screen, and will make for an adequate late night thriller on the telly, but unfortunately it offered little more."
"""Luca"" is about a race of merpeople??? Luca (Jacob Tremblay) is a young Italian merman/merboy who dreams about life on the surface. His parents, Lorenzo and Daniela Paguro (Jim Gaffigan and Maya Rudolph), however, are deathly afraid of the surface and don't want Luca anywhere near it. Luca defies his parents with the help of another merboy named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer). When he gets to the surface he finds that he becomes an air breathing, tail-less, human boy. He enjoys every minute of surface life, but he has to keep his true identity secret if he wants to stay safe from the townsfolk who are afraid of sea monsters.I enjoyed ""Luca."" I knew the moment would come when he and his friend Alberto was discovered, but it wasn't as dark and ominous a moment as I expected. Even with the somber message, ""Luca"" never got too down and depressing as I've seen some other animations get."
"We've been saying ever since the purge that Frank Grillo is a star, he should be a lead in a franchise. A BIG franchise. The whole cast was excellent mel gibson is always great. I have to say though my favorite part was hearing the GREATEST band EVER!! BOSTON!!! THE MOST UNDERRATED UNDERAPPRECIATED band of all time!!! Listen to brad Delp's incredible voice, tom Schulz incredible guitar and the most positive music EVER!!! We miss you brad delp!!!!best action movie this year....By far!!"
"I hesitated watching this movie, because the story was so ridiculous and I didnt much like some of the really gross bloody scenes (not suited for below 16!). But half an hour into it, I did get the hang of this violent story and started to like it more...The good: the computer game like action is fantastic and over the top, with some really gruesome scenes that made me look away though (extracting your own teeth!). But all the violence is portrayed in a lighthearted, funny way, just as in a computer game, so I could cope with the gruesome violent scenes. More good: the story (however ridiculous) does have a really nice twist to it, that is rather charming. To top it of, Mel Gibson is back in a great bad guy role, with some cool oneliners and a couple of good jokes. This is simply good old fashioned action fun, with many great looking special effects!Any bad? The leading actor looks like a B-movie hairdresser, without any charisma. But who cares, this is a computer game movie, with only macho fighting stereotypes. It's all about the fun of continuous figthing scenes with a lot of gruesome killings...The story: fight, fight, fight. A man has to relive the same day, every day of his life. And that particular day just happens to be a day in which he gets attacked by dozens of assasins! Will he ever get out of this repeating killing maze?"
"This film start with a video game layout, and the main character ""Roy"" killing the man ""Mr. Good Morning"" try to attack him scene! As turnout, this film is about a woman ""Jemma"" created the so called ""Osiris Spindle"" to let Roy save her from a villain ""Clive""! Entire film full of intense action scene! Such as, car chase scene, car crash scene, bloody shooting scene, sword fighting scene, bloody slicing scene, bloody stabbing scene, things broken scene, and explosion scene! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, after saving Jemma, Roy going into the Osiris Spindle to stop the time loop! That's it! Another must watch action film!"
"Frankly Grillo is in very good shape. The film has the same repetitive stuff again n again.
The plot n ending is terrible.
After a while the film is not able to hold attention cos of the monotonous stuff.
Naomi Watts is totally wasted n the less said bah Mad Gibson, the better."
"It is intense and suspenseful. It doesn't use jump scares, which is impressive."
"This starts off really quite strongly. The Warren's - Ed (Patrick Wilson) and wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are brought in to conduct an exorcism upon a young boy but somewhere during the process, the spirit manages to swap bodies and the life of the boy's older friend Arne (Ruairi O'Connor) starts to take on an unpredictable nature that culminates in him being charged for the murder of his friend - which we know he did. Was he possessed at the time of the crime? Well the Warren's decide that they are going to try and offer this as a form of defence and so they set about tracking down his demon and proving their point. It's from here on in that the thing falls away quite badly. John Noble hams up terribly, Farmiga and Wilson don't really work together convincingly and the ending - though quite tensely directed - just isn't scary in the slightest. Perhaps we are all becoming just too numb to the impact of visual effects to create menace? It is certainly becoming more difficult for a director to get those ""jump"" moments, especially with format horror like this. Sadly, truth isn't stranger than fiction any more and if the ""Conjuring"" is to continue, it will need quite a creative overhaul. This is worth a watch, but is pretty unremarkable."
3 out of 5 stars.The third film does offer some thrills and scares. But the direction is a little less grounded this time. Getting away from the haunted house concept to following an investigation on a person being accused for murder which he was possessed.Great cast. But little less scares.
"I find this film flat and boring. I find the story rather offensive, as they make fun of a person who appears to be vulnerable. I can't get into it at all."
"NOT funny. And just as a reminder it is suppose to be funny.Perhaps very young kids could like it, but then again this movie has got a PG- 13 rating so that wont be a possible market. And I simply cannot imagine any teenager having fun with this sort of NOT funny ""comedy"", because it is so terribly childish.If you are an adult, simply pass this one by..."
"I would give the worst to That's My Boy(2012), and some others like Mr. Deeds(2002), You Don't Mess The Zohan(2008) and Jack and Jill(2011). But Pixels was his fun to me, has we'll has Anger Managment(2003). Where does Hubie Halloween fall into that, we'll it's pretty bad, the plot goes all around, it's what you'd expect from this type of Adam Sandler comedy, but there where two times I did laugh.
Adam Sandler gives an over the top performance as Hubie, to the point where he seems to animated to be a real character that can be relatable, Julie Bowen is in this movie just to have a love interest for Sandler, nothing more. And everything else falls flat, Kevin James looks like he's not having any fun here. Halloween comedies can be done, but Hubie Halloween does not quite do it."
"Adam Sandler stars as the title character as he attempts to impersonate Bill Murray in ""Caddy Shack."" Not as good and not as funny. Hubie gets Steve Buscemi as a new neighbor which is scary in itself. Hubie is the picked on village idiot who tries to do good in the town of Salem at Halloween. It has word play ""b*ner"" jokes as the funniest aspect of the movie, to give you a clue. The cast includes a bunch of known names and Sandler uses his family in a way that would make Judd Apatow green with envy. Now that would have been funny having him in the film turning green watching Adam using his kids. It was wasted potential.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Just stupid jokes."
"I liked it, I don't love Adam, I even have my reservations about these American besteroles, but seeing a hot ex-avenging and winning is comforting, and the movie, although very stupid, is fun pathetic, and ridiculously funny... Worth the time invested..."
"The bad:
Seen these kind of action thrillers before. They are pretty much all the same. There is nothing new to this story either and there are a few pretty implausible plot turns, that prevent it from becoming a spectacular thriller. BUT it is still a rather enjoyable action thriller, for those whose demands are not too high...The good:
The acting is pretty good. Angelina Jolie is still beautiful at her older age and she still mesmirizes me with her acting skills. The other actors aint bad either. Despite some predictable and implausible plot turns and despite a predictable happy end, there is still enough action and suspense to keep me entertained. Rather impressive firestorm photography tops it of...The story: Angelina Jolie protects a kid who witnessed a murder, during a firestorm. Will they survive both the fire and the killers who are chasing them? Duh..."
"Well its a film where smeone gets pursued and tried eliminated, the only problem for me is to figure out why???. Try it yourself and you may feel the same. Is it a political inspired take out due to reduced budgets on a federal scale, and howcome the film starts in florida with a person that you arent given any background stuff about less than he has a brother in law out west, montana working as a police officer there... well the plot and story aint the best unfolded one, but its kind of chilling, much thanks to a rush of nonstop action, killings and pursuits with some decent acting all over. I think the actors doing the ''take em out'' roles does a real good effort , acting as a crook agent or whatever, some are just born to be sly when acting...so if youre in for the firefight there aint any fight, just a fight for life and fight against ptsd. So grap a ticket while its still hot and available in the theater, cause the rush of adrenaline is the proclaims the grumpy old man, with a recommend."
"Too many unnecessary scenes and infantile dialogue riddled with foul language you'd never expect to hear from those spewing it. There was way to much time spent on filler and not enough on substance. What was the point of that entire outdoor drinking on picnic tables act? The pick-up truck parachute and arrest scenes? The constant repetitive flashbacks only inching each time just a little more facts on her past incident also became annoying. Just spit it out, and move on with the current drama and all too little excitement. Never mind it was totally boring and pointless for the movies plot-line. Even the idea of the cat and mouse wasn't concluded, nor why it even started or who ordered it. The screenplay felt like it had random scenes cut out and/or was poorly edited. The 100 min runtime felt much longer with all the boring filler. I'm not sure if the book is as bad at the screenplay and direction, but this one had a great conceptual idea that ultimately burns out quickly. Jolie was the worst casting choice, and for the most part was unconvincing in her role and her acting abilities. Her swearing trying to act all tough with her long stringy hair was just getting annoying and unbearable. The little boy was more believable than her. Too bad, the premise was great, was it was poorly executed."
"Forget about hate speech. The movie is very enjoyable, the cast is great, the script is terrible, the acting is great, the comedy dose was good, the bad words as always ;) I found what I expected from the movie. It was pretty fun."
"If you know your greek you will recognize this tweaked version of a Scarface quote (the 80s Scarface that is in case you have a very well versed film knowledge). Another thing to know: the film features a lot of foul language and a lot of violence. Is there a big story behind it? No this is more about shooting cool stuff, explosions and quotes to take home.As a Greek I sort of almost wanted the villain to succeed. Of course not really because after all he is bad and evil, right? But it was nice to see a Greek bad guy for once - and very well established and sawn into the financial crisis and into general history. And while it is not an actual Greek playing that role (Papadopoulos or Papad..less as he is also called by Sam Jacksons character at one point), Antonio Banderas is not only a great actor who is great, he also learned or knew some Greek words he threw in there for good measure. Always a nice thing to hear that and while it may only be a minor detail, it is something that is much appreciated.Also his history with Salma Hayek makes this almost meta. Not to mention a ""cameo"" that I wasn't aware of, that has a funny scene with Samuel L. Jacksons character ... his voice may be one of the most recognizable ones ever.So this is case of style over substance ... but in a very good way."
"Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek reprise their characters in this sequel to the action comedy The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017). In a rather more convoluted plot that adds Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman to the list of characters, this sequel does not really break any new ground, but does pull together the elements of action comedy in a bit splashier way and incorporates a decent dose of emotional backstories and somewhat more personal intimate scenes that add a nice balance to the action comedy. The threat to the European Union is quite a nice new spin on mass destruction. There are a few places where the movie threatened to become an unintended parody but pulled itself out with experienced acting. Overall, this movie is an enjoyable summer movie that offers a little mental attention to follow the plot and the relaxed luxury to join in the visual and auditory physical action, the light-heartedness, a few poignant moments and come out satisfied if not ""exuberantly"" and ""amazed."""

"""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we watch a new version of ""Space Jam"" of 1996. Instead of Michael Jordan there is LeBron James who has to work together with Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes to win a basketball match and not letting artificial intelligence achieve its goal.Since I had already watched the first movie of ""Space Jam"" I knew what to expect from this new version of it. The direction which was made by Malcolm D. Lee was average without achieving to intrigued audience and make them feel that they are also a part of this movie following his main characters. The interpretations of LeBron James who played as himself, Don Cheadle who played as Al G. Rhythm and Cedric Joe who played as Dom James were good and their combination worked pretty good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" is an average comedy movie and I advise you to lower your standards if you want to watch it otherwise you will be disappointed."
"After 25 years since Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes appeared together in ""Space Jam"", another reboot or remake of the franchise was made in ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"". It stars LeBron James, who tries to chase Michael Jordan in the GOAT (Greatest Of All-Time) conversation, just proves once again that he is not him on and off the court especially with poor acting unlike Jordan,who was clearly having fun in his role in the original.It was apparent the comparisons will be made compared to the first movie released in 1996. While the digital and visual effects are a lot better, it proves once again that LeBron does not have the marketing appeal that Michael has. That is why you see a lot of ads(from LeBron and Warner Bros) implied on the film and focused on it rather on the story it has.Well, this movie was released to capitalize on both stars being the best of their respective generation's NBA players. Too bad that this movie proves once again that LeBron is not comparable to Michael even off the court.Take note,I am not even a Jordan fan. Wilt Chamberlain is the true G. O. A. T (Greatest Of All-Time) in NBA History. Hands down. Not LeBron nor Michael."
"The film is only fairly entertaining, but it is very predictable. There's quite a bit of advertising in it, the logo of a sports brand is prominently displayed on two occasions. The inclusion of other Warner brothers films are too hard sell as well. Overall, it is a brainless film that is not very brilliant."
All I'll say is I told you so...Last Words: It's complete hash.
"Extreme unrealistic stereotyping of teaching styles & classroom student behavior. Came across as a promotional film for alcohol. Opening monologue of roughly, ""We're born to have a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.05%; in other words born with a deficit of 0.05%, (1-2 glasses a day) to maintain a happy state of mind; to increase social & professional teaching."" Please!, they wouldn't last a week while imbibing before and/or during class time. Happy party scene at the end was pure dumb."
"This film from Thomas Vinterberg is well made with good performances, but it weirdly suffers from being both predictable (drinking too much inevitably leading to negative consequences) and from glamorizing alcohol use (for both kids and middle-aged men). You could say that's a good thing, that a black and white view is not presented, or that it accurately reflects Danish culture, but it just seemed kind of off, or in any event, it wasn't very compelling to me. I liked the score with its interesting mix of songs, and Mads Mikkelsen's dance moves. Overall, though, I didn't think it was particularly honest about the experiment the teachers embark on or the main character's trajectory, with that joyful ending. It seemed like it wanted to have it both ways, and would have been better remaining a dark statement on the culture of drinking, from adolescence through adulthood."
Take away the CGI and the A-list cast and you end up with film with less punch than almost any Disney movie from the 1960s.
"This movie delivered as promised, Godzilla and King Kong duking it out. The storyline was a bit far fetched... but can you really expect anything less? All things put together it was pretty good, the cgi and cinematography were amazing to watch."
"The 4th in the series of reimagined monsterverse movies finally sees Kong and Godzilla brought together. In the mythology of this series they are both on our side, kinda, as ""Titans"", avatars of worldwideworthness, but they are also huge rivals. In particular, Big G can sense Kong leaving Skull Island: apparently he needs to go home to get an upgrade, and home is apparently the hollow centre of the Earth. We also have a number of human factions, all of whom have their own agendas.There is quite a lot of apparent plot here, but much of it is unnecessary and irrelevant. However, it is nicely played by a good cast (no Nick Fury, Captain Marvel or Loki, but we do have the lady baddie from Iron Man 3). There is also a great deal of utter, utter nonsense: Florida to Hong Kong by secret high speed underground tube travel in what appears to be 10 minutes, anyone?But, of course, this is all about a pair of 400 foot tall antagonists beating the snot out of each other, and that is there in abundance. Hong Kong will never be the same. And, unlike the first in this series, you can actually see what's going on.It really is the most ludicrous tosh but, even while I was shaking my head at how preposterous it was, there were times when I felt like cheering.This is hugely enjoyable big-budget trash cinema."
"Not bad, while message heavy I think that wad kind of the point. The acting was decent and the main cast had good chemistry. For 'the purge' it lacked the gritty fighting I would have expected. Storyline was pretty basic and had a good but expected ending."
"""The Forever Purge"" is an Action - Horror movie and the fifth movie of ""The Purge"" franchise in which we watch another annual purge happening but this time it does not stop after twelve hours but continues and seems that will never end.I did not have high expectations from this movie because I had watched all the previous movies of this franchise and the plot is more or less the same in all those movies. The direction which was made by Everardo Gout it was good and he presented the main characters in a nice and simple way while he focused not only on the purge but also on the back stories of his characters. The interpretations of Tenoch Huerta who played as Juan, Josh Lucas who played as Dylan Tucker, Ana de la Reguera who played as Adela and Leven Rambin who played as Harper Tucker were good for a movie like this. Lastly, I have to say that ""The Forever Purge"" is another similar purge movie of the franchise without adding anything new so, if you have already watched the previous I do not suggest you to watch it and spend your time on it."
"This film start with two people walking, and they went into a tunnel scene! As turnout, this film is about a man ""Juan"" need to survive from the killing of a bunch of people refuse to end The Purge, and eventually reunite with his lover ""Adela""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the training horse scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the dining scene, overuse of the long angle scenery scene, and overuse of the staring scene! Make the film unwatchable! The only intensity in the film is the explosion scene! The car crash scene also very slow! All the killing scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, shaky, just hear the gunshot sound, have slow motion in it, and occur in too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Juan killing the last people refuse to end The Purge, and unite with Adela! That's it! Another disappointed sequel!"
This is the fifth film in the Purge franchise and a direct sequel to 2016's The Purge: Election Year.This one has ample amount of action but somehow the tension is missing.I still enjoyed it. The sun soaked settings added more fun n it was good to see Josh Lucas aft a long time.I was hoping for an exciting showdown in the end but alas.
"I'm not just talking about the Warner Bros. and HBO Max same day streaming and theatrical release schedule, either, or referencing the general avoidance of cinemas during the pandemic, although I do generally miss the bigger picture, although not so much in the case of ""The Little Things."" It having the uninspired quality of a 1990s lesser crime drama variation of ""Seven"" (1995) to it (indeed, it was originally written and appears to be set in that decade), I could imagine being satisfied waiting a few months to rent a VHS copy of it, or not seeing it at all. Starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto, there's a lot of Oscar-winning talent wasted here. Washington gets one brief characteristic outburst during an interrogation where he seems to break character to play the caricature of himself he often plays, but for the most part everyone is relatively subdued. It's a run-of-the-mill serial killer murder mystery with hardly any artistry to remark upon. Even the supposed ambiguities or uncertainties are uninteresting. The little things of this genre piece may be there, but there's no bigger picture to validate it."
"It's definitely derivative and it almost certainly has some issues with the choices it takes in the last 15 minutes, but The Little Things succeeds with tension, atmospheric creepiness, and the performance of Jared Leto. I think we all would have hoped for a little more from the 3 of these leads, but it still contains some fantastic cinematic moments.6.9/10."
"An army experiment gets loose outside of Vegas which becomes infected. Sealands piled three high create a wall around the city. The President plans to nuke the city.

"You know how they say: there's nothing new in the zombie genre? Well, this movie 1000% proves that to be true.The tagline should've read: ""If you liked I Am Legend, Aliens, Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Extinction, Warm Bodies, Escape from New York, Zombieland and Ocean's 11, then you've already seen Army of the Dead!"" (And I know I must've missed another 6-7 films this straight-up ripped off.)As stated, this barely had a new idea, but probably worse, it had almost zero characters to root for. No one was that likable and everyone's fate is so horribly predicted from moment one. This felt much less like an homage, than just a very poor attempt at plagiarism.The one Brightside was the Nice Vegas backdrop and creativity with the Strip. I also knew they were filming inside The Cromwell during the pandemic (which probably wasn't safe at the time) so it was neat seeing how they transformed the place.Nope, can't recommend. The aforementioned movies are 10x better than this cheap cheat. Save yourself from the excruciatingly long and unnecessary 148 minutes."
"This initially seemed promising.However after half an hour the film started to drag.Pointless scene followed pointless scene.I sat there hoping for something to happen,but really little did."
"Beautiful period piece with love and charm throughout! So delightful the way everything is set up, I love Anya Taylor Joy she's a wonderful actress in any project. Elegance of great magnitude and tranquillity. Emma deserves better/more appreciation; I'm barely a fan of period pieces but this is definitely among the best."
"Emma is a subtle comedy, delving into issues of marriage, sex, age, and social status. It was the last book of hers published while author Jane Austen was still alive. About the character Emma she said, preparing to write the novel, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.""Emma is 21 and privileged, she fashions herself as a matchmaker and most of the stories that develop result from this. It truly is a comedy of manners. Not slapstick comedy, the type of subtle British comedy.This movie pretty well follows the novel and Anya Taylor-Joy to me is just perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She is a good actress but I especially love to look at her face, with her wide-set eyes and perfect lips. Strangely after she was selected to play the role she was hesitant, she said she didn't think of herself as attractive enough. In fact in an interview she said, ""I have never and I don't think I will ever think of myself as beautiful. I don't think I'm beautiful enough to be in films.""Bill Nighy is very good as her wealthy father Mr. Woodhouse and as often happens when he has a supporting role, Nighy steals every scene he is in.Good movie of a familiar story, I enjoyed it. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped."

"I really enjoyed the invisible man, it was a different kind of thriller and it works. Elisabeth moss slayed as the leading lady, developing well throughout the film and delivering a killer ending. The acting was good, the storyline development kept a good pace, and the action scenes awesome. Really enjoyable thriller."
"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) flees from the isolated mansion of her husband, the awarded physician Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), with the support of her sister Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) during the night. Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and Emily´s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). When Adrian surprisingly dies, Cecilia inherits his fortune. But when weird things happen with Cecilia, her sister and friends, Cecilia believes Adrian is invisible but not dead and is sent to a psychiatric clinic. Is Cecilia insane?""The Invisible Man"" is an absolutely overrated film. The screenplay is not good, with many plot holes and with poor development of Adrian Griffin and Cecilia Kass, performed by Elisabeth Moss, looks like a crazy and unbalanced woman most of the time. The viewer never sees the claimed abuses of Adrian and how Cecilia finds that he is invisible in the beginning is a great mystery. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""O Homem Invisível"" (""The Invisible Man"")"
"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) escapes from her controlling partner Adrian Griffin to her friend James Lanier and his daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, she is surprised when her sister Emily comes with the news of Adrian's death. Adrian's brother Tom is handling his estate which leaves Cecilia $5 million. Mysterious things start happening and she suspects Adrian's hand in the matter.I was intrigued with taking the invisible man to the horrors realm. The start needs to give Adrian more time so that the movie has a firmer grasp on its villain. When the situation starts to turn, I get the feeling that the tension is not quite high enough. Looking at an empty room for the invisible man is intriguing for about two minutes. Then I realized that I already know the cause and therefore there is no mystery to the movie. Also, it's unlikely that the dead man is the automatic suspect. I'd go with Tom first and she should be investigating Adrian's death. James is possibly the worst cop ever. A lot of it could be set up with more of Cecilia and Adrian's relationship before the escape. The ending is also problematic. Being over two hours, the last bit should be cut for various reasons. The premise remains intriguing but I would change a few things."

"Nomadland won three Oscars and it's well deserved even though I wouldn't say it was the best motion picture of that year, or the best directed one but that's just my opinion. Frances McDormand though deserves her Oscar. She's an actress that always delivers and in Nomadland she looks so natural playing her character that it almost looks like a documentary. Some of the rest of the cast are actual nomads, living from day to day, from one place to another, far away from the rat race, and that's what makes this movie stand out. Watching people living completely different than what the norm is supposed to be is just entertaining. I applaud people that do their own thing, sometimes by choice but too often because society gave them no other option. It's a hard life, but when you think about it I'm almost sure those nomads are happier than anyone else. The idea of camping in the most beautiful sceneries, it's a luxury some pay a lot of money for every vacation. Living like this is a choice and it seems like the best choice if you're fed up with the mass consumption society where you need to produce all the time, just to fit in. Nomadland is a good movie, maybe not the happiest movie, but certainly food for thought."
"I don't really understand this story. She makes some choices in the film, but the reason she makes these choices aren't explained."
"It delivers. It doesn't limit itself to be just an action/drama/revenge film, it gives important lessons about choices, about relationships, about grief and about forgiveness.Once again, Mads Mikkelsen has a fantastic performance (that moment on the bathroom, god damn!) but all the supporting cast do a very good job."
Mads Mikkelsen is a Special Forces guy who returns home to Denmark after his wife is killed in a train accident. Two computer geeks meet up with a third and visit the very angry but not grieving widower. His teenage daughter is not dealing with the situation well either. Riders of Justice becomes a cross between Death Wish(with much better acting) and Boondock Saints. I cannot praise this film highly enough. Mads is perfect and the supporting cast superb with a surprisingly sarcastic script to accompany the necessary bloody violence. Trust me on Riders. It is one of my top three films of 2020.
"An explosion near a train kills some passengers. Among the dead is a man who was going to testify against the bike gang, ""Riders of Justice."" A man who creates algorithms (ones that can tell us rich people drive Mercedes and poor people drive Kias) survived the blast and believes it could not be coincidental. He believes a man who exited the train had something to do with the blast. He involves a few other people, including military man Mads Mikkelsen who lost his wife in the explosion. They enact a plan of revenge.The film also looks at how things interact, how small unrelated events trigger larger ones. In this instance, an Estonian girl wanting a blue bicycle as opposed to a red one starts it all off. The group of characters are enjoyable and there are a number of light moments. I liked the ending.I watched the film with subtitles.Guide: F-word. Brief nudity. No sex."

"First I want to say how great this state-of-the-art animation is. As my wife commented early in the movie, it's hard to believe that is animation. The effects, the facial expressions, everything. Second it took over 900 people working in over 400 homes during the worldwide pandemic to pool their talents to make this movie. Quite an achievement.But all that wouldn't matter if the story were blah. It in fact is a cool story in a fictional Asian world where some time earlier a menacing force turned many people and even dragons into stone. However it turns out one dragon remains and together with the young heroine they seek to reunite the several fractured factions of people to reclaim their former peace and cooperation.We enjoyed it at home on BluRay from our public library."
"Like many Disney movies these days, I was more-or-less obligated to watch. My daughter was excited about it and wanted me to watch it too. As they say, ""If you like it, I love it."" Well, not quite. I fell asleep for a spell. I think one of the druuns got me and turned me to stone for a few scenes.""Raya and the Last Dragon"" takes place in a fictitious land called Kamundra. Without going into the detail of the hows and whys, the main character has to collect pieces of a broken crystal ball in order to bring back all the people turned to stone by the druuns (a plague based upon the discord of people that took physical shape). The main character, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), is aided by the dragon Sisu (Awkwafina),The movie was funny and upbeat, just not enough to keep me fully engaged."

It was really an emotional biopic . A great story with lots of emotions and heartbreaks. Salute to a great hero of this nation. Jai Hind!
Good movie to watch for especially the war and super VFX scenes the movie has been brilliant shot the movie has got some good war drama.

"Been meaning to watch Freaky for awhile being horror is my favorite genre, love the cast and the director glad it came on HBO! This movie is so much fun and refreshing. The story is very enjoyable where it's a horror version of Freaky Friday with touches of comedy mashed in. The Butchers mask is so awesome/cool looking which is another great aspect about the director kinda like Happy Death Day was very original at least with the mask. Kathryn Newton is perfect I love her in nearly anything! Thanks for appreciating my review to those that have!"

"I really was expecting a bit more from this. The premiss that a bunch of bored, rich, folks kidnap a dozen ""deplorables"" and plonk them in a wood whereupon they are hunted with guns, grenades and good old bows and arrows could have been quite fun. A sort of ""Hunger Games"" without the endless CGI. What we do get is a really tame, poorly executed horror flick in which virtually all of the dozen are dead within the first five minutes and we embark on a truly implausible hunt by the survivors to turn the tables. The two in the gas station inject a little levity into the proceedings but otherwise it is rather a missed opportunity that will not linger long in the mind."
"THE HUNT (2020) *** Betty Gilpin, Hilary Swank, Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Amy Madigan. Part pitch black comedy cum horror film part political satire with a dozen strangers finding themselves being hunted down without any idea why and who among the reasons of a diabolical revenge plot. Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof's screenplay has larger aspirations with its pinprickings of every social strata in 'merica however the characters are more or less caricatures and with names like 'yoga pants' obviously not interested in developing their backstories. Gilpin is the wild-card as the shrewd final girl and her battle to the death with the event's villainous Swank is one of the best recent cinematic fights ever. (Dir: Craig Zobel)"
"Two thirds of the film you are going to ask yourself two questions: 1. Why is the movie called Sweet Girl when it is all about Jason Momoa? And 2. How can that little adolescent turd not be wrecked with guilt for her stupidity and instead is sanctimonious and judgemental with her father and continues to never listen to anything he says? The twist provides the answer to both and it's pretty satisfying, but it works for about a second before you realize that it invalidates most of all the other things that happened until then. Then comes the ending, which is really weak.Maybe if I could have been invested in any of the characters beyond a generic sob story and a generic villain that anyone hates, I would have enjoyed it more. There is no positive to watching the film, the action scenes are generic, the story is generic, the characters are generic. Other than the twist, which feels very 1990s anyway, there is nothing that is not forgettable five minutes after the credits roll."
"Gave it a good half hour before turning it off. I like to give films a chance but it didn't keep my interest. I felt like it was a generic action film and whilst action is great in films, script is more important."
"A problematic film, this one, but not without merit. Localised and shot in and around Pittsburgh so as a Romero fan that was a nice treat. Jason Momoa can do this kind of role in his sleep by now so he's as good as you'd expect. The big pharma back story is very timely, but it never really ties up with the BOURNE style hitmen and bodyguards running around all over the place, it doesn't feel too realistic. The writing is kind of sloppy here. As for the big twist at the climax, I didn't mind it all that much personally but I can see how some might. One strong point is the action choreography which is always on point."
A heart wrenching move about a father and daughter who are intent on getting revenge and justice for their mom/ wife.
"I've never been there but a have a soft spot with any movie that's filmed in and around Pittsburgh, PA. I blame it on the films of George Romeo but who knows? The terrific location photography is the only part of ""Sweet Girl"" that's worth watching. It's a silly piece of propaganda aimed at an audience that's too old to care. The likeable cast ends up spinning their wheels in pretty bad material."
"""News of the World"" is one touching emotional throwback style of film that can be classified as a historical drama and an adventure journey of hope and discovery. Set five years after the civil war an ex soldier Capt. Kidd(in a good performance from Tom Hanks) now not in battle travels and roams lands and countrysides telling stories and delivering news of happenings all across a still torn country. His life and journey is thrown into a wild card and spin while in his Texas travels he meets an innocent and precious young little lady named Johanna(the charming and wonderful Helena Zengel). The two bond and get to know one another.Along the way this film becomes somewhat of an epic travel journey and adventure like film with the drama of danger as the will to fight for life is ever present for both Capt. Kidd and little Jo(as she has a past connection to the Kiowa people). The story is entertaining as the acting and chemistry of scenes was in top notch form as it shows how travel and journey leads to discovery and new hope as it brings an emotional connection and new life for both of the two central characters. Overall watch if you enjoy historical like dramas."
"This is a nice movie that's generally well made. but it's just too boring. tom hanks is his usual awesome self. but i question if this story was worth making a movie out of. there isn't enough substance or intrigue. (1 viewing, 2/3/2021)"

"The story is good, especially the final scene. However, it doesn't resonate with me, as their lives are so far from mine."
"Review By Kamal KTamil Nadu is one of the states where cinema and politics blend comfortably and Jayalalitha is one such flamboyant personalities who has left a trail of bright dots in both these fields.The movie starts off with Jayalalitha's Paanchali Shabadam and then traces back to her entry into movies,her intimacy with MGR and how she carved her way into a Male dominated political structure.If we go through the journey of Jayalalitha, it is RESILIENCE written in bold all over it and who else better than (Kangana Ranaut) can be rightful for this role.And for the bountiful of talent that Arvind Swamy is,its never too difficult for him to play any role.If Dulqer as Gemini Ganesan in Mahanati left a lasting impreession ,then Arvind Swamy as MGR too left a perennial impact.Samudrakani played the possessive confidante of MGR with poise.Karunandhi's rationalism, atheism and his literary prowess hasn't been explored much as his role was very confined.The writers didn't delve too much into a lot of other incidents and other important characters like the enigmatic Sasikala's as this movie ends with Jayalalitha taking oath as Chief Minister for the first time and her subservient MLA's bowing down to her which has now become a common scene in Tamil Nadu's political space.At the end,this movie leaves you only wanting for more as there's lot that could've been told."
"Kangana potrayal as Jayalalitha is awesome and win our hearts. Not only that, thanks to Karky and Vijayendra Prasad screenplay and Vijay direction, the film is watchable and her career best act. Defintely it is a must watch. Don't miss it."
The fictional biopic goes on the theme of 'women empowerment' and has delivered it quite convincingly. The casting is too good and everyone has given their best performance. The interactions between J and Samuthrakani take the scenes to next level. Dialogues from Karky esp. For Karuna's character is just brilliant. Good entertaining film adaptation!!
"Kangana potrayal as Jayalalitha is awesome and win our hearts. Not only that, thanks to Karky and Vijayendra Prasad screenplay and Vijay direction, the film is watchable and her career best act. Defintely it is a must watch. Don't miss it."
Good Movie. Everybody acted well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie was good. The movie was interesting and thrilling. The movie was interesting and thrilling at 1st half. Good Movie.
"How incredible to be able to see this show on TV instead of going to New York and spending $800.After watching it, I wished I had seen it live. A production came to my home town and the last row in the balcony was the aforementioned $800.Anyway, this is a fantastic and memorable show, all the more important for maybe getting a few kids interested in a) historical characters; and b) Broadway/musical theater.The music is not my demographic, but there are many different styles, and I loved some of the songs. The lyrics were clever. I think Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius.What I love is the originality, the expansiveness, the singing, the choreography, but most of all the incredible energy of the cast and story.For people who have no interest in seeing our forefathers dancing and singing, I say, watch it anyway. I wasn't interested either. It is fabulous."

"Religion figures prominently in this slice of American Gothic from Antonio Campos but it's the old time religion of the Old Testament rather than the New and it's the Devil who's in the driving seat in ""The Devil All the Time"". Covering a period of about twenty years and with a multitude of characters, most of whom come to a sticky end, it's a darkly funny piece of Americana set in the backwoods of West Virginia where murder is more common than a prayer before bedtime.We've been down these backroads before, of course, all the way back to the seventies. Scorsese cut his teeth on material like this as did Malick and Campos shows us you certainly can't keep a good genre down. It meanders a little and jumps back and forth in time maybe more than it should and it's certainly overlong but it's well-acted, (particularly by Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland), and very nicely narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, author of the original novel."
"This is a drama with a lot of killing. The film first focuses on Willard (Bill Skarsgård) in 1957, a WWII vet who has seen horrors. It then shifts to his son. We needed Willard to understand his son Arvin (Tom Holland). The film shifts between small towns in Ohio and West Virginia and has a subplot. It also contains third person narration that was done by someone doing a light version of Sam Elliot. Next time just get Sam Elliot and don't call any of the characters ""dude.""It nicely develops many characters to give you a feel for the town folks. Most was done by narration, which I normally find annoying and poor substitute for a good scene. That was not the case here. It flowed.Guide: F-word. Sex. Nudity, mostly in B&W photos."
"The story spans from WWII to Vietnam War dealing with deaths in religious rural America. Willard Russell (Bill Skarsgård) returns home from WWII in the Pacific after suffering from trauma. He marries waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett) and together they have son Arvin. Arvin (Tom Holland) would become an orphan. He moves in with his grandparents who have adopted Lenora Laferty. They are raised as siblings. Lenora falls for new preacher Reverend Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson). Oh, there is also serial killer couple, Carl and Sandy.This is a jumble. There is a lot here. There are some good performances. Skarsgård is especially good. The cast is terrific. There is a sense of places and times. It would be nice if the story could be simplified to just Arvin's life. There is too much story with too many characters although it's never confused. I love the themes of religion and death. I also love that this movie is going for something expansive. It's probably going for too much."
"The special effects are good, but I didn't get into the story. There's also little chemistry between yet m the two leads."

"In 2257 there is a colony in New World. There is a village of all men who can read each other's thoughts. They have been out of contact for a long time. A scout ship crashes with Viola (Daisy Ridley ) being the sole survivor. Unlike men, women's thoughts can not be read, but they can see the thoughts of men. The Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen ) wants to do her harm. Viola takes off with Todd (Tom Holland ) to seek refuge in another village.I didn't like ""the noise"" gimmick. It made the film annoying to watch as we hear people talk while their thought is going at the same time as we watch thought-action inside the real world. As typical Daisy Ridley has very little personality.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"""Chaos Walking"" is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch a young man helping a mysterious young girl who crashed on his planet. There all the thoughts of men are called 'Noise' because they are presented above their heads and can be heard from everyone.I found this movie very interesting because it had a very different and new plot, something that I had not watched before. The interpretations of both Tom Holland who played as Todd and Daisy Ridley who played as Viola were very good and the combination of both worked very well. The direction which was made by Doug Liman, it was very good and he did an excellent job on how he presented both his main characters and the plot, something that made more clear a lot of things that could confuse the audience. To sum up, I have to say that ""Chaos Walking"" is an interesting movie and I advise you not to hear the critics and just watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it."
"The story: cops who were corrupt get slaughtered by a serial killer. Can cop Chris Rock find the serial killer?The good: beautifully photographed.The bad: cheap violence cant cover up the fact that this movie is below average, at best. The supporting actors are mediocre, but worse, the 2 great actors Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson act below par as well. The dialogues and the story are simply boring and full of the usual cop cliches we have seen a zillion times before.More bad: there is no real suspense. There are no jokes either. The action / horror is cheap and only used to cover up that this movie is boring from start to finish.This movie is made without any soul or originality. The money to make a good movie was there, but the time and will was not."
"First time seeing two different IMAX movies in the same day I got to see Wrath of Man as well that's irrelevant but amazing too. Darren Lynn Bousman continued a beloved horror franchise with new faces I'm proud of Chris Rock being in horror I don't think he's done anything like it! Spiral is just as gruesome as any of the Saw films with a little bit of comedy, dirty cops, and plenty of games to be played. Well worth the money and better than a lot of the sequels."
"What a piece of garbage!
Maybe if some pre-teen girls are gathered for a movie night together. Busy with their phones and tablets, so the movie dont interrupt them to much. This movie would maybe be somewhat okay....
The storyline is terrible, and the acting is non existing!
Then she want, then she dont want, then she want, then she dont want and so on.... And the same for the ""bad boy"" who is just a total doll!
I want you, now I dont want you, I want you, now I dont want you!
Oh my oh my oh my....."
"Another film with a dyed non blonde, that doesn't like her natural look so has to change it."
"First of all, this movie series is not for those whose idea of love is like that which they see in disney movies. This film series shows a realistic portrayal of love. Even though I personally don't enjoy romantic movies, I had enjoyed the first movie because it is realistic.Now coming to this movie, it was ruined by overacting by almost everyone especially the main leads. As a direct sequel to After, this movie focuses on Tessa's job as an intern and how she deals with the revelation from the first movie. The poor plot and poor execution along with overacting are exactly what ruined the whole movie.Another thing I noticed is that a few characters from the previous movie were played by different actors. What's up with that? The director is also different."
This movie was unbelievably amazing for story. I just never expected that this kind of movies can also have that much good love stories.
"Margot Robbie is the joker ... not the Joker, but like a joker. As in I love her so much, it is almost impossible for me to see a movie with her and not like it. Ok jokes aside, her character has finally some development here, in stark contrast to the Suicide Squad movie she was a part of.Concentrating on women is generally a good thing. The problem some may have is not that, but the cliches that will become quite apparent throughout the movie. Not to mention the sheer luck (or coincidence?) the main characters seem to have. If you don't mind this and are all for female (em)power(ment) and don't mind the one brush of character our bad guy has (Ewan McGregor is still quite amazing, even with so little to play with, no pun intended) ... you will have fun. Not everything has to be excellent ... still a long way to come back on top though"
"This seemed like a story DC Comics did for the sake of getting it out of the way. I didn't care much for it, not being able to warm up to any of the characters. I haven't read any comics in a couple of decades, but any so called super-heroes who don't make the A-list I generally have no patience for. I wouldn't even call these 'Birds of Prey' super-heroes in the traditional sense. Black Canary's (Jurnee Smollett) ability to scream her way out of a jam is about the lamest thing I think I've seen in the genre. The best thing to witness in this picture are the well choreographed fight sequences which are impeccably timed and quite creatively accomplished. Most disappointing was the camera's non-flattering treatment of Rosie Perez as Detective Renee Montoya; it seemed like a casting error in contrast to the other members of the group. Given the 'f' word strewn dialog and callous behavior of all these 'birds', I'd suggest you look for your role models elsewhere. Not to mention locking your kids up in the basement when this comes on."
"Fear Street Part 2: 1978 is a Horror Slasher Movie. We are back in Shadyside. We go back to 1978 after a scene with Deena, Josh and C. Berman. Nurse Lane fights with Tommy.

Alice got knocked to death by Tommy. Cindy beheaded Tommy. Alice died. Cindy and Ziggy got surrounded by the killers. Cindy got killed by Tommy. Ziggy got killed by The Milkman. Nick revived Ziggy. It turns out that C. Berman is Ziggy, not Cindy. Josh and Deena found a corpse. Deena her nose is bleeding.Such a great Slasher movie!"
"The best part of this movie was the acting, a far better cast than the first part and more chemistry between the leads. The problem was the lack of slasher action, both in volume and diversity. It takes 40 minutes for the plot to get going and then it's one note til the end."

"I must admit that whenever Liam Neeson stars in a movie, then it is a movie that I feel that I must watch, because he definitely has a track record of some rather impressive movies these last many years.However, when I read the synopsis for ""The Ice Road"", I must admit that I wasn't exactly overly impressed. But still I sat down to watch the movie, as it had Liam Neeson in it, after all.And I must say that writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh actually managed to put together a good old fashioned thriller. And while the concept may have seemed a bit off, then it actually worked out well enough with having the movie take place in the frigid colds of northern Canada.The storyline told in ""The Ice Road"" is one that quickly lets its frostbite set in and director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn't let you go before the movie comes to an end. I have to admit that I was genuinely more than entertained by the story told in this movie.Needless to say that Liam Neeson does it quite well in this movie as well, of course he did. And he was joined by the likes of Marcus Thomas, Laurence Fishburne, Amber Midthunder and Benjamin Walker for a rather interesting and fast-paced thriller.""The Ice Road"" was definitely a surprisingly good movie, and it was one that provided me with proper entertainment.I am rating ""The Ice Road"" a six out of ten stars."
"Definitely a movie to set your rational brain aside and watch simply for the sheer fun of it. That seems to be Liam Neeson's forté lately, and he does it in overdrive in this flick. Call the movie bad if you want, but one has to marvel at the way the film makers produced all the disasters in the picture, the first of which removes Laurence Fishburne from the story in a pulse pounding scenario. I'm watching this with my wife and she's got a blanket over her face every few minutes trying to ward off the inevitable. The backdrop to the story involves corruption at a regional level in which a company skimps on methane detectors and pays its miners to shut off their sensors. The cave in that develops results in Neeson's character and his disabled brother (Marcus Thomas) in a high stakes race over the titled 'Ice Road' to deliver a wellhead that's needed to save the men from suffocating. Starting out they're not alone, but conspiracy and espionage undermine the effort and at the finale, it's a race to the finish that defies credibility, but you don't watch this for a credible story, just the adrenaline rush. The mission is completed successfully for the most part, but not without it's share of misery for the brother truckers."
Watching the ice road was like watching a movie in slowmo. The fight scenes were terribly coordinated and dragged out. For such a simple objective the actors spent a lot of time standing around and bumbling about. The script was poorly written and the plot was thin. Shaky science and lame CGI. A poorly made mess.
"I have seen ALL Liam Neeson movies and I watch every new one. Unfortunately this one is lacking punch. It is not a bad movie, simply never getting really suspenseful at all. Kinda boring to be honest, not something I wish for in an ""action"" movie...The bad: mediocre supporting actors, mediocre dialogue, mediocre photography, mediocre direction. Get the drift?Not any good? This is still a Liam Neeson movie in which he saves the day and becomes a hero. He is still the solid, good guy who will fight for the right cause.Not recommended though because there are many better other Liam Neeson movies out there."
"Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) gets picked up by the Mauritanian police after 9/11. It's the start of his odyssey to Guantánamo Bay. Three years later, New Mexico defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) gets recruited to be his lawyer. She is joined by junior associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley). Meanwhile, Marine lawyer Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) is recruited to be the prosecutor to give the prisoner a death sentence. He is eager for the job after losing a close friend in one of the planes. Former classmate Neil Buckland (Zachary Levi) is involved with the interrogation.Director Kevin Macdonald delivers a clear-headed dissection of the case against Mohamedou who is known here as The Mauritanian. The power of this movie comes from a straight forward telling of his story. I am uncertain about portraying the torture but somehow it has to be laid down on film. I would consider a less direct approach to give the audience some space. There are a few lines of dialogue that I wish Nancy would say. The performances are beyond reproach. All in all, this is a powerful truth seeking missile of a film."
". . . warning our USA Homeland about a threatening incursion of an invasive counter-culture which belligerently refuses to assimilate into our hallowed melting pot. Viewers need look no further than the flags of IN THE HEIGHTS to detect how divisive, imminent and overwhelming these insurgent dangers actually are. You'll be able to see one single, solitary Stars and Stripes out of your peripheral vision during HEIGHTS' 133-minute running time (blink, and you'll miss it) as opposed to at least 74 Communist Cuban banners front and center for seemingly half of this dance marathon. Beyond the grotesque gyrations constantly blockading the U. S. taxpayers' public streets, this cautionary tale stresses the wanton moral turpitude of the foreign flag loyalists. Everyone knows that ""Tee Key Torch"" marchers are as vile as they come, so of course we see such a burgeoning parade here at 1:31:42. Whether it's fixing the lottery results, evading immigration laws, purse-snatching, shoplifting or violent ice cream wars, HEIGHTS deftly depicts an incoming tsunami wave rife with lawless disrespect of American norms, expectations and traditions."
5 out of 5 stars.Great musical film. With a touching story. And message. Love the cast ensemble which they all did great with there musical cues. The soundtrack and musical sequences are amazing. Love every one moment of it. The direction is powerful and colorful. Making it one fun musical film.
"The film is not an upbeat musical that I was expecting. It is actually quite depressing, about an immigrant community experiencing hardship in a deprived area. The story is quite slow. The only impressive scene was the synchronised scene, but that was too short. The songs are not very good, and I found a particular song likening New York subway to slave trade rather distasteful. Overall, I did not enjoy it."
"With this phenomenal cast it should have been a slam dunk decent thriller, its probably not just a 1 but based on my expectations with the director and cast I was expecting so much more. It really never takes hold or has any tension that you expect in a thriller. The premise starts ok but fizzles out and the ending is extremely negative and reveals nothing you dont see a mile away. I mean go read who's in the cast and you'll agree wow we have a classic coming. It was free so not upset so GLAD I didnt see this in the theater!!"
"This is a heist movie. For any heist movie, you're better off just re-watching ""One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty"". The genre is formulaic by design, often involves a cast of very well known people and movies in it should be performance pieces. I mean, no one cares about the loot or what happens in the end, they just want to be entertained by the loops and twists of the story and the way actors make you care about their characters. And on that metric, No Sudden Move is average at best.Right now I am struggling to mention anything that might be worth mentioning and getting nothing. It's not like people acted badly, but their characters were completely uninteresting and the story went nowhere. Even if it was ""inspired"" from the story of the catalytic converter and the collusion of all big car manufacturers to keep it off the market, which is true, the rest was complete fiction. And the plot? Just people double and triple crossing each other. No action, no real stakes, no inspiring end. Just Soderbergh being nostalgic over the times when the Ocean's N movies were bringing him a lot of money.Bottom line: I can't recommend it yet I can't say it was a bad movie. It was just... uninteresting."
"The film uses (PLOT SPOILER) the suppression of the catalytic converter by the auto industry as a back story. In Detroit 1954, three men are to ""babysit"" a family while dad breaks into his boss's safe to get documents, documents that have been removed.The plot is rather jerky in how it moves taking enjoyment out of the feature. It s always nice to see Ray Liotta get beat up. Matt Damon in an uncredited role explains the workings of the world.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"A truly stunning Steven Soderbergh masterpiece. Colors, music, dialogues, costumes, detail in the use of cameras, the harmony of every actor and actress... Sodenbergh is the greatest conductor of our time."
"Love and Monsters is a strangely lighthearted post-apocalyptic story. And while the premise makes it sound like a low-budget TV movie, I was quite impressed with the visual effects and the overall production quality. Dylan O'Brien is a highly relatable protagonist, and this quirky creature flick had more heart than I expected. I think more people should know about this film."
"Cold-blooded creatures and insects have mutated and grown to monstrous sizes wiping out most of humanity. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) has been living in an underground bunker community for the last seven years. He's lonely after getting separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). He freezes in stressful situations and is not wanted in any confrontations with the monsters. He decides to head off on his own to Aimee's seaside community. Along the way, he befriended a dog named Boy, and two survivalists Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt).Dylan O'Brien is a charismatic enjoyable lead. The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on. Overall, Dylan is great, the middle is great, and the rest needs work."
"Fairly good CGI of monster insects turning the tables on humans to make them the munchies. Not very believable that only insects & invertebrates get to supersize (also not structurally possible per even high school science).
Cause: The usual asteroid episode encounter w/Earth. Teen hook of teen goes on perilous journey (accompanied by dog of course) to see girlfriend. Left open a sequel monster mash. High school drama class level acting & dialogue.
I'm rooting for the insects to clean up Earth."
"I am not sure if anyone is enjoying my riffs or how much sense some of the funny things I come up with as summary lines are making - or even if some consider them funny at all. Having said all that, the movie is funny. But even that can be judged differently by differnt individuals. The CGI work is really well done and the story is well thought of.Of course every fun moment or any moment in general happening here can be taken and dissected. Even if it has so many wink wink moments - as in knowing what we expect and try to surprise us while also delivering on what we want to see. The story is predictable - but that does not stop this from being really entertaining from start to finish. Great actors round the whole thing up - actaully my first thought concerning a summary line was ""Maze Runner meets Iron Fist"" - ok so it may have been a stretch, especially because there is not really so much hand to hand combat here ... but would be relying more on the actors involved. Enjoyable to say the least! I wouldn't mind a sequel as well."
"I enjoyed this way more than I expected. It has love, adventures and humanity in it."
"This horror movie is so pc or en woky that the director and writer forgot the horror - this German movie is an excellent example of what's wrong with many, if not most, movie productions these days - too many people who have a ""mission"" are involved or people who just ride comfortably and without taking any risk on the wave of zeitgeist. Really, I confess, I was on one side annoyed but on the other side fascinated - in past times people wanted to make a horror movie to entertain and maybe add their footprint into the making of the art of horror. Today, people seem to be contend to ""clean"" everything with total pc stuff and call it creative and progressive (I call it comedy) but just use an overused plot and make necessary woky changes. Orson Wells would have a lot of fun these days. Anyway, back to the movie - production, effects, gore and acting is below average. Wrong Turn 2021 - a movie nobody really needs (besides a certain kind of people). Watch the movie with the same title from 2003 again (no matter if this movie is related to the franchise or not, if not it is a money grabber too) and your time is far better spend.Last note: in a certain sense the title of the movie is what one could be tempted to call prophetic."
"The problem here are the good guys. They come across as purely horrible people. When you first meet them they irritate you, and they do it in the same vapid way people that have a BA in BS think they educated enough to decide what is best for everyone on earth living in situations they have never experienced....... and that attitude carries over to their interaction with the locals, who they insult and belittle in a way that is framed to almost side with the protagonists.So, when the killing starts, they have annoyed you to the point that you want them to lose, and you want to see the backwoods cannibals eat them... just so you don't have to hear them drone on and on in their pedestrian hipster snobbery any longer.So you there is no suspense, no hope that the protagonists make it out a live, because the film took enough time to make certain they irritate you to no end. And that kills the suspense.And then, on the other side, they muted the backwoods hillbilly cannibals too in both appearance and Deliverance style redneckiness, so there is really nothing grotesque or horrible about them, and, instead, so they really aren't frightening, not so deformed, not at all horrific.In fact, the only thing that makes them remotely decent is the fact that they are killing the other characters that annoyed you to the point you wanted to walk away... about 10 minutes into the film."
Should've had horror when the car has a flat tire is probably the worst thing about it. Other than the car aspect this Wrong Turn is epic more horror than expected but the main characters aren't very likable where as unfortunately I wouldn't mind if they all died. Its a very mediocre adaptation of a masterful horror! So many bad things happen that's not exciting for the genre; one of few occasions where I support the villains. The terror/violence is easily the best aspect by far!
"But ever so cliched, dumb descisionmaking kinda story, with a clumsy caracterbuilding and messed up timeline. it also lacks the realfeel acting, a script that could be better evolved and the historical basement very loose, quite stupid actually., when a load of raindeer calves threatening you with stone and bone quacking some kind of icelandic esperanto, wheres the coherence.apart from some brute forcede bloody gore in between and some fine scenic shoots, there aint much to talk about, so do take the right turn, as the grumpy old man didnt.its a no recommend..."
"A group of friends set out to hike the Appalachian Trail. After getting lost they stumble across a sinister man in a strange outfit. This meeting will have a profound impact on their lives and see their lives threatened by a strange cult.The 2003 Wrong Turn was a surprisingly decent horror movie, with a reasonably good plot and good performances. The success of this film caused the producers to create five sequels, all of which were incredibly bad, being made for the money and falling back on the usual horror clichés and formulae.This film is essentially another one of those sequels, relying entirely on the Wrong Turn name without bringing anything original to the table. Quite dull and formulaic with a middle section that doesn't make too much sense.Avoid."
"Co-helmed by the guy who wrote Wall-E, Up, and Inside Out and directed the latter 2, Soul is yet another amazing film. It goes deep, covering the nature of existence, the important of dreams and life, the need to find meaning. It goes funny, with crazy gags that leave you breathless. It goes visually stunning, with remarkable imagery. And the plot is constantly moving and shifting and surprising.Seriously, just watch it."
"This year's sure-fire Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature and probably Best Original Score, ""Soul"" is a brilliant mess of a movie more likely to appeal to adults than to children who almost certainly won't 'get' it, (and they certainly won't get the references to ""A Matter of Life and Death"" unless they have sophisticated cineaste parents). In some ways it's both old-fashioned and ground-breaking, at least in its attempt to push the boundaries of children's animation while never reaching the sublime heights of say ""The Incredibles"" or ""Inside Out"". The animation may be extraordinary but we've been here before.The title, of course, has more than one meaning. Soul might refer to what a good jazz musician puts into his music but more fundamentally here it also refers to what we are all said to carry within us. Quite early in the film our hero finds himself on a 'Stairway to Heaven' to give that Powell and Pressburger film its other title and from here on it alternates between the avant-garde and that old-fashioned Pixar formula right down to a talking cat, (big mistake). A brilliant voice cast, (Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Angela Bassett, Daveed Diggs and a surprisingly cast Graham Norton of all people), do what they can with the material but the scirpt is uninspired and it is noticeably lacking in gags, (I think kids will get bored quite quickly). Not one of the greats, then and maybe not even the best animation of the current year."
"If you've seen the original, you probably do not need to see this. I had no idea this was a remake when I watched this. But I had a strong feeling of Deja Vu. I was quite glad I had seen the original. Overall the first movie to go a certain place is better than a remake. Rule of the thumb or however the saying goes.This still can be a lot of fun. Yes it is CGI heavy, yes it isn't the best CGI ever and all that. But it can be fun to watch. Unless you are a witch and feel this is misrepresenting your way of life ... ok kidding aside (I hope that is a joke you say? Yes me too), some things may be considered offensive, but you could say similar things about the original too.A fun family film with some shockers in between - maybe not for the very small ones then."
3 out of 5 stars.The Witches is a fantasy thriller about a young boy who lives with his grandmother. Only to learn from her that witches exist. And they hate children. When the boy comes across a witch. Grandmother decides to take boy out on a getaway at a resort. Which conveniently a group of witches are hosting a convention. Led by Anne Hathaway. The boy and another gets captured and turned into a mouse. Which they try to stop the witches.Cute and fun film for the family. But cheesy cgi and visual effects makes the movie feel cheapily put together. The acting was also decent with the cast ensemble. The story also comes out short with barely anything to mention.
"When Hero's (Jahzir Bruno) parents die in a car accent in Chicago,he is raised by Octavia Spencer, the world's greatest grandmother. Unfortunately a coven of witches led by Anne Hathaway are out to change kids into mice and curse them with the voice of Chris Rock. The main action takes place in a swanky hotel.It was a fun film. I can see kids liking it."
"I didn't grow up with the book, nor did I see the 1990 film until very recently, so I have no nostalgic affinity for this story. Keep that in mind when I say this: I actually kinda dug this. Everything about Hathaway rules: the giant performance, creepy design, dramatic arrogance. Yes, the other performances are oddly lackadaisical, & Zemeckis desperately needs someone to stop him from his unending use of unconvincing CGI. Otherwise, this is a bold, old-fashioned, decidedly un-family-friendly family yarn."
"I've recently been watching Roald Dahl's ""Tales of the Unexpected"" and thought this would be along similar lines, but it turned out to be more a movie for kids. I even turned to my wife as the witch coven began blowing up and turning into rodents stating, can you believe we're watching this? This while our twelve year old granddaughter sits on a laptop with her Roblox; I would have had her watch this with us to get her take on it. The picture is mildly entertaining, though I will say the direction given Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch left a lot to be desired. She was just too irritating, although that was probably the point. Now that you've got my mild warning, I'd advise you to haul a couple of kids into the room to watch this with you, as it would probably make the experience more enjoyable. I did like the comforting advice offered by Octavia Spencer's character, the old Grandma in the story, when near the end she stated to her three little mice - ""Never give up what you are inside"". But I don't know if it was a good idea to leave her grandson and friends as tiny rodents. What kind of message is that?"
"This is the story of Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya ) who lead the Chicago branch. He had one too many bills. It is also the story of Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) the FBI informant who assisted in getting Fred assassinated by the FBI and Chicago Police. The story starts with Fred already as a leader and with Bill getting arrested and becoming an informant.I imagine the role of the traitor was a tough one for LaKeith Stanfield who came through as a reluctant informant. While the film touches on the black struggle, he is not weighed down with being preachy , just letting the facts speak for themselves.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" feels like a companion piece to Spike Lee's ""BlackKklansman"" from a couple of years ago. But whereas Lee's film was angry, funny, and fabulously entertaining, ""Judas"" is more somber and feels saddled with the burden of being IMPORTANT.Daniel Kaluuya received most of the attention and the Oscar for playing Fred Hampton, leader of the Black Panthers who was assassinated as part of an FBI raid. But it's Lakeith Stanfield, as the film's titular Judas, who impressed me more. Kaluuya's performance consists of a series of loud speeches, but Stanfield is the character with the story arc, a man who must live with his decision to act as an FBI informant. Stanfield was at least nominated along with Kaluuya, but true to Academy form, loud and showy always triumphs over quiet and thoughtful.It's a solid bit of movie making, but it's lacking something that could have made it a blaze of outrage rather than the tsk tsk tsking history lesson that it is.The end credits song ""Fight for You"" brought the film a second Oscar, while it scored additional nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.Grade: B+"

"Essentially a two-hander concerning both prominent Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton and hustler-turned-FBI-informant Bill O'Neal, 'Judas And The Black Messiah (2021)' tells one of the many frustrating tales surrounding the US government's shady but nowadays not-so-secret efforts to quash any form of racial equality within its jurisdiction. O'Neal is, for the most part, the piece's POV character, acting as a way for the audience see behind the scenes of both the Black Panther party and the FBI's efforts the crush it. That doesn't mean that Hampton is relegated to a lesser role, though; he dominates the screen whenever he's present, yet he's humanised in such a way that he comes across as much more than a series of rousing speeches and steadfast negotiations. Both characters are played almost to perfection, their respective actors - Kaluuya and Stanfield - encapsulating the dualities and nuances that the script demands. It's great stuff all around, an expertly crafted production with an admirable intent and the often overlooked ability to really get you invested in its story - which, in this case, relates not only to an under-seen aspect of history but also to something that's still keenly relevant to this day. The narrative is really upsetting - angering, even - because it tells the tale of a total massacre of justice; the betrayals of the picture - which extend beyond its title's bold metaphor - hit you where it hurts. 7/10."
This is a killer story with an exciting twist. The main character has got a distinctive charisma. I enjoyed watching it.
2 out of 5 stars.Jolt is a bad action comedy film. Lacks the humor and comedic moments. Filled with cheesy direction that tries to keep the energy electric pacing. Plot about a girl Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) who has an impulse rage control which she uses an electric device to keep her anger down. When she finds a guy she may love. And something happens. She goes on a revenge spree to find the bad guys responsible.Plot is thin. And forgettable. A twist that may be predictable and lacks the surprises. Except for a fun surprise cameo of who shows up at the end.The action sequences are forgettable. And dull fight scenes with a fast editing scenes put together. Boring music score and dull direction.Kate Beckinsale is great but her talent is wasted in this action role.
"Kate Beckinsale tries to pull off a Charlize Theron in her latest sci-fi actioner (in the same universe as Crank) to middling results. Not that her arse-kicking is any less exciting. The awkward wig, cosmetics and the obvious presence of a stunt double aside, she's quite solid as this I-hate-people protagonist with an anger problem. But the central plot is so thin and unexciting that the only fun the film offers is in its fast-paced set-pieces. The core element of aggression (being subdued with the aid of mild electrocution) is simply used to deliver short and thrilling but generic pieces of action. The supporting acts (featuring the likes of Stanley Tucci, Jai Courtney, and Bobby Cannavale) are just what they need to be. The writing (by Scott Wascha) is utterly weak, with a nonsensical plot, zero character development, and some really silly dialogue at times. Jolt is the kind of film that'll get erased from your mind pretty soon after you've seen it."
"Always was a fan of the cat and mouse duo ""Tom and Jerry"" so for sure I watched the latest big screen movie, and must say it was really good and entertained as the way the animation mixed with live action and people characters was super great. Set in New York City the big apple the tale involves a wedding(only things get elephant like crazy!) And both the cat and mouse take up shop in the luxury loft elegant hotel and their chases entertain! Wrapped around it all is a young lady and hotel lobby worker Kayla(Chloe Grace Moretz) as all become friends and learn about the ins and outs of life! The music score and scenes are well done as it even has avid fans thinking back to memories of the old classic Hanna Barbera days. In the end things stay the same with the classic chase rivals only it's live happily ever after for others. Good tribute and entertaining movie of the classic cat and mouse duo."
"Animation is so well done reminded me of Who Killed Roger Rabbit where the real world is mixed and they interact with the cartoons. Anyway I see why so many highly rated Tom and Jerry it's so lovable, heartwarming when Chloe Grace Moretz character says it's like they've been fighting years. I'm so happy there was more animation than you'd expect that's great for fans! Tim Story is very good at making feel-good films."
"Well, I'm a little bit puzzled and lost. It's not bad movie. First half was really good and funny, second half lost it's unique point and just lost me as a viewer. Why I'm puzzled? This movie is called Tom and Jerry and we see them less than half of movie. Better option woul be to change this movie tittle to ""Tom and Jerry stuck in comedy"" or ""Tom and Jerry traveled into different dimension"". Now, we see real people and everything, except that, all animals are animated. In one of scenes flowers were animated also. I didn't get why and it wasn't explained. As an adult I found this film not bad but if the main audience is family with childs I think kids won't like this movie. I liked that they added scenes from Tom and Jerry TV episodes, it was very nostalgic. Film was ok, I would recommend to watch it but it still needs a lot of changes to consider as Good or classic movie."
"It times feels like two movies at once, Tom and Jerry stepping out there comfort zone and into the real world, playing off the live action characters, like Chole Grace Moretz and Michael Pena.
A fun time for anybody is a Tom and Jerry fan, animation was good, not for everybody I mean building a movie around this is not easy, the original Tom and Jerry cartoon is just a series of shorts. so it can not be those two going at it."
"The bright, colorful ""Tom & Jerry"" brings the cartoon duo into the real world, and even if it never amounts to much more than a series of escalating hijinks, it provides a fair amount of laughs outside the antics of its namesake duo. Loved it. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 3/16/2021"
"Bhoot Police review :A desi Ghostbusters type movie and a supposed horror comedy; Bhoot Police neither scares nor tickles your funny bone. At most, it makes you angry at the slip shod plot, drab screenplay and a rather uninspiring performance from the entire cast. Director Pavan Kirpalani, who made Ragini MMS (2011) and Phobia (2016) earlier, goes horribly wrong this time.If the idea was to make another 'Stree' (2018), sorry to say but Bhoot Police doesn't grab your attention for even a minute from start to finish. In fact, the first five minutes itself make you realise that this is going to be one bore of an endeavor. Saif and Arjun are ineffective. Yami appears lost. Jacqueline looks sexy and still can't act saala. As for Rajpal Yadav and Javed Jaffrey, I sincerely hope that it was the lure of a fat fee which made them sign up for such thankless roles!!Without wasting any more time and effort, I end my rant review with an AVOID warning.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
"At one point in Bhoot Police, a character, addressing a crowd, advises them not to believe in the two tantric babas who have been hired to drive away the local chudail. They have only been hired because their father was a famous tantric. She says: Nepotism ne yeh poora desh barbad kar diya hai. And on cue, Saif Ali Khan and Arjun Kapoor, playing the ghostbusters Vibhooti and Chiraunji, give each other a look. Both actors are of course, products of nepotism themselves and their knowing expression made me smile. But that's pretty much as clever as Bhoot Police gets.Read the full review on Film Companion."
"The script could've much better. Still it was good. Fun, entertaining and some mindless horror sequence. Saif, Jaaved and Yami were good. Arjun was just okay. Jamie lever performed better than Arjun and Jacqueline."
"Previously, Pavan Kripalani has given us unique horror films like Ragini MMS and Phobia. But, this time he completely failed.The World they tried to create here was really visually good looking, but it was not enough. The script was very poor. It's neither funny nor scary. No dialogues made me laugh. And the scary moments were clichéd.I only liked Yami Gautam in this film. Besides, I didn't like any of the characters.As there's nothing in the film, you can definitely miss this.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.© MandalBros."
"If you're looking for a nice Saturday or Sunday evening entertainment, this is the movie for you. Bollywood actually needs such horror comedies. Saif ,Arjun, Yami, Jacqueline, Javed Jaffee all in one and do their parts well. The atroy itself is fun, with comedy all through. Yes, the climax could've been shortened a bit, but it's ok, I am already looking forward to this been made as a franchise of sorts. It could actually breathe some new life in the tired Bollywood Horror genre, which is none.Full credit to the director too."
"What a rush. What a thrill. What poetic violence.After movies like this, ""6 Underground,"" ""Ronin,"" and others, can we please have more movies set in foreign countries? Let's break away from the monotony of New York, L.A., and Chicago and go international: Mumbai, Tokyo, Lagos.The premise of the movie is simple and it's all in the title. A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer's kidnapped son. It's pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn't need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn't even ask the price. Some odd hours later he's in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. ""Extraction"" was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It's a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged. Ooooh! give me more."
"Wow this is very good! The centrepiece is the one take action scene that lasts for almost thirty minutes, encompassing car chase, gun shots and jumping off buildings. It is intense like you cannot imagine."
"I've been watching all of the Netflix-produced action movies for a number of years now and have generally enjoyed all of them, particularly the run of movies starring Noomi Rapace that they released. I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax. What a delight to see America finally catching up with the likes of China's WOLF WARRIOR 2 in terms of films featuring lavish, wide-scale thrills and spills."
"Greetings from Lithuania.The first mistake of ""Host"" (2020) i think that in its 56 min. length it was hardly possible to establish 4 or 5 characters at the same time. There was only a situation and jump scares - and that is it, that is the whole thing (I can't even call it a full feature film). In ""Host"" you get a premise as old as a Blair Witch herself. And we have seen all this stuff being done so many times, and in a so many better horror film. Even a first ""Paranormal Activities"" movie was a masterpiece in comparison with this one, because it took its time to establish situation and characters. Unfortunately ""Host"" doesn't have any of this. And there is also one dude Teddy i think was his name, who was so obnoxious that i was pretty happy when he was out of the picture at the end so to speak - literally.Overall, ""Host"" isn't a terrible movie, and you can see an attempt to make something good on a very low budget and premise. That is not a bad thing, if its done right. But in 56 min. you only get bunch of jump scare scenes with some faces on a laptops. This is what ""Host"" basically is."
"This film start with a bunch of people having video conference, and the introduction of the medium of a seance ""Seylan"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Seylan unexpectedly summon an evil spirit causing dead of the six friends! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the yelling scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the searching scene, and overuse of the arguing scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after Haley scare by the ghost, still have a real seance footage conduct by the cast member! That's it! Wasting time to watch!"
"So, here is a pretty fantastic horror movie. I had reservations about watching it because it's filmed entirely through Zoom, which felt like an irritating gimmick, but I got used to it pretty quickly and didn't even notice it after a while.This could be the newest ""Paranormal Activity"", or ""Blair Witch Project"". You know, low budget movie, no-name (but fantastic) actors, get together and make a genuinely scary movie.The fact that it is only an hour long is a strength, as there is barely any extraneous material in the movie.I say check it out."
"Watching a review on YouTube by Double Toasted,I was surprised to hear them mention a code for free 30 days on the streaming service Shudder. Signing up,I decided the film film I'd unlock to view,was one I've heard a lot about under Lockdown.View on the film:Zooming into production during Lockdown, co-writer/(with Gemma Hurley & Jed Shepherd) director Rob Savage displays a inventiveness in creating chills,whilst filming under social distancing, via sudden close-ups on the screen capturing how helpless the others are in being unable to help out.Wisely kept to a lean runtime of under an hour, Savage dials this Found Footage with surprisingly creepy special effects, where the limited bedrooms location gives the moving chairs and shattering glass,a invasion of personal space eerie atmosphere.Making Haley regret her prank on the call, the writers take the major plot point from the interesting Hammer Horror title The Quiet Ones (2014-also reviewed),and wastes it,with little drama coming from the accidental conjuring,instead going for Found Footage jolts and jump-scare crashing sounds, over poor performances across the call,with the cast failing to create the impression of being mates before the call is cut."

"Due to the repetitive nature of time loop movies, they have to be done right in order to keep the audience engaged the whole time. Palm Springs does it right. This film does a great job of keeping things fresh. Andy Samberg shows that he's more than just a goofball, and Cristin Milioti proves, once again, why she should have had a more prominent role on How I Met Your Mother. I wish this film were a little less vulgar, so it would be accessible to a broader audience, because I think more people should take a trip with Palm Springs."
"Funny movie with an interesting story. andy samberg is awesome. cristin milioti gives a beastly performance. good love story. (1 viewing, 2/24/2021)"
"For a film that rips its premise off the ultimate time loop movie, ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Palm Springs"" is surprisingly unpredictable and exceedingly charming. It's got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It's a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it's not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It's all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven. How I can relate to that right now.....Grade: A-"
"This film start with a little boy run away from the monster, and a witcher ""Vesemir"" saving him scene! As turnout, this film is about Vesemir need to killing a villain ""Tetra"", who hated witcher! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the running scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse of the blackout scene, and overuse of the drinking scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene quite bloody gore, but overall have slow motion, messy, not intense, and occur in too short in time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, after killing Tetra, Vesemir recruit the orphans to join him! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
"Netflix as a company is mostly miss on their productions. This film is one of the few exceptions, it's a solid production.Firstly, Netflix have avoided the woke - it's a well done.Secondly, the story is quite interesting and well paced, although it occasionally jumps and you have to pay close attention.Thirdly, the film is very violent at times and it's something I have never enjoyed about the Witcher series - the violence serves no purpose. If you compare this to Romper Stomper or Fight Club, you will appreciate what I mean. Both of those films revolve around violence with a purpose ... or even V for Vendetta.I would not recommend this for sensitive younger viewers. I enjoyed it enough to watch it a few times."

"What was the point of the first half of the movie?So I am kinda confused. The start of the movie shows a boy being saved by a Witcher from a monster that kills all his sisters or friends. He gets taken in by the Witchers grows up, then becomes the Witcher that saves himself as a child...then the story continues from here.. But i am seriously confused. I did not fall asleep or anything. It makes no sense to me but even without this, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. Nightmare of the wolf? What nightmare? What wolf? Not much content in this movie, yet not too bad of a flick."
I only went to see this film after seeing is score on imbd but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.There was plenty of action and a good plot. I didn't understand a lot of it but it was good fun.I would go again to see another film like this.
"I had so much fun with this movie, it was only playing in a theatre a half an hour drive away from where I live so I drove to the theatre and was blown away by just how good it was.The animation was amazing. It's was fluid, kinetic and very crisp and detailed. I was a bit hesitant on watching it at first, since I knew this movie would hold some major spoilers for the seiries, and I've only watched the first episode of the anime show since I've only known about it for a week since discovering it on Netflix. This movie does have major spoilers though, but I encourage you to see this in a theatre as soon as you can if tv spoilers bother you or not.I was worried that the whole movie being set on a train would get stale fast, but it is always exciting and doesn't drag a bit. If watching Train To Busan taught me anything, it's that movies set in limited spaces such as trains can still be constantly exciting if it stays engaging. This movie just like Train To Busan isn't entirely set on the train, there are flashbacks and an action sequence seperate from the train.Anyway this was an exceptional movie with very good direction and animation. It was thrilling and also very emotional. Don't miss this one"
"This movie isn't even a movie or at least it doesn't use the same formula as any other. It's pretty much action for 3/4 of the movie, and the action is absolutely incredible! It's so fluid and amazingly thought out and it comes together so well! The crazy thing is this movie all takes place in the one area, excellent use of setting throughout. There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie. Until the end...the action shuts up and the tears start :( bruh...it so sad. It's so well done I can't put into words how baffling the ending is. If you've seen the show you gotta continue it sooo good and it leaves it for future projects. :D."
Graphics are amazing the story is good pretty sure we will have a sequel.But even better the music they chose was amazing.All in all very violent not for kids but a great anime for adults.
"""The Woman in the Window"" is not a remake of ""Rear Window"". It deals more with questioning one's sanity (whether or not this involves gaslighting). Not a masterpiece, but worth seeing."
3 out of 5 stars.Fair film. Psychological thriller that offers some twists and turns. But is a bit dull at times. Decent cast.
"Russian caviar or alaskan lobster served to the feinsmaeckers of silver screen entertainment, so if youre looking for good script, intellectual dialouges, existensial human ethics, vertigizing filmatographics and senior editing management et cetera dont even try this out. and just a warning to all prone to epilepcy, there are large amounts of blinking lights that may give you the shivering hi!!because its has bad sound, lame special effects, incoherent plot, extremely bad lightsetting and unsteady camera movements, crank call musical score, and stupid children songs chiming outta silly animatronics.so this said, its all bound to become a cult classic for the gory horror nerd, even though just covered in hydraulic oil and for the rest itll become a see-saw within 15 minutes.acting is pretty operational decent from mr cage, but the rest of the cast seems like a bunch of dyslectic whimps that has to be told what to say. its allthough some nice idiopathic comedy in there somewhere, so behold when the grumpy old man gives a small recommend on this one. it would for surtain have been a buster 30 years ago, but 2021 with mr cage at the brink of retirement i can for sure guarantee there are better b-movies out there to choose."
"It Seems the Cerebral ""Taxation"" on Nic Cage's Brain Drew Him to Produce and Star in a Literally ""Mute"" Performance.Opting for the Exclusively Physical Effort.Beating the Hell Out of ""Commercial"" Style Ad-Characters Used to Pick the Pockets of Celebratory Parents and Kids.It's Often Said that ""Kid-Favorite"" Clowns are Inherently Scary.The Same Could be Said of the ""Chucky Cheese"" Types.While the K(C)lowns Got Their Movie ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"" (1988), a Fun and Frightening Cult Classic.Cage and His Movie-Makers Try the Supernatural Route with these Anything But Lovable ""Willy Wonderland"" Characters.The Titular Furry Robots and Cartoonish Characters, You See,have been Possessed by Satan-Worshiping Child-Killers that make a Suicide Pact to Come Back.To Inhabit these Demon-Dolls and Get to Literally ""Feed"" Their Perversion.The Movie is Non-Stop Gore as Cage, a Drifter who is Tricked into Becoming a Meal for the Bad-Bots,Pummels, Slices, and Dices the In-Animates for Your Entertainment During the Duration.Nothing Much Else Happens Except a Group of Teens who Show Up so there can be Multiple Victims.It All Ends Up being a Video-Gamish, Ultra-Violent, Mash and Bash Movie.If That's What You Want...That's What You Get.The Film Delivers on that Promise Profoundly, and Precisely."
"Unfortunately, the good nonsense (Cage as a mute monster fighter obsessed with pinball, the design of Willy's Wonderland) is lost in the bad nonsense (cheap filmmaking, lazy storytelling, complete illogic between scenes). I would love to see a better filmmaker (Edgar Wright, James Gunn, Rogen/Goldberg), or even a much worse filmmaker, take on a possessed-Chuck-E-Cheese story...but I feel like this might've been the one chance, and we BLEW it!"
"A driver (Nicolas Cage) suffers a flat tire on a remote road. He gets a tow into town where he is hired to be a janitor at a closed Willy's Wonderland. It's essentially a Chuck E. Cheese's with animatronic figures in individually themed rooms. The place is a mess and he's locked in overnight. Local girl Liv (Emily Tosta) tries to burn it down and gets arrested by Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant). Her friends help her escape and the group returns to burn down the place.I like the general premise and the place. I love Cage's obsessive cleaning although his character should start differently. Instead of a bad mother driving a muscle car, he should be a simple workman driving a beat-up truck. He should be poor which would explain him working as a janitor more easily. I like the teen group for the most part and they are good cannon fodder anyways. I like the animatronic killers although the killings get a bit repetitive. It's lots of fun the first time around but it gets a diminishing return with each kill. All in all, it's fun for awhile but the fun does diminish."
"""I Care a Lot"" is a Comedy - Crime movie in which we watch a woman working as legal guardian and taking advantage of elderly people to drain their savings. A lot change when she does the same to another elderly woman but she is more than she appears.I liked this movie because it was different, it had an interesting plot and some good interpretations. The only thing I did not like it was the way the plot was presented and how it was changing through the whole duration of the movie. At first I though that it would be a crime, thriller movie but after some time I understood that it's a comedy. The interpretation of Rosamund Pike who played as Marla Grayson was simply amazing. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Peter Dinklage's who played as Roman Lunyov and Dianne Wiest's who played as Jennifer Peterson. To sum up, I have to say that ""I Care a Lot"" is a nice comedy movie to spend your time with but do not expect much otherwise you will be disappointed."
"One of the best CGI fantasy environments I've seen. The detail; color saturation; 3-D naturalistic movement of the nasty critters, and just a whole lot of them to keep you on your toes. They borrowed scenes from many past sy-fy movies, but did so in quality creative ways. We are given Dune sand monster w/footsteps on sand; above & below ground spider & web chase & entrapment; sand storm w/electrical discharge; dinosaurs (especially the rib cage scene reminds me of ""Pitch Black"") & fire breathing dragons; flaming swords; 3 masted sand schooner; monolithic mysterious structure; ""Guardians"" raccoon equivalent cat; parallel world. Just a very complete mixed bag even the dirt on the characters was real. Except, Milla still has lipstick - not uncommon w/female action characters. Nice adaption from the game."
"This movie sucks!A complete waste of a great lead cast, especially Tony Jar.The audio is abysmal.The story is worse than the audio.All the fights are mediocre at best.The visuals are beautiful and easily the only good thing about the movie.Sets up for a sequel that's NEVER going to happen."
"I was expecting this to be a run of the mill awful action film with one note performances, but surprisingly I was entertained, although I'd say not a great film, but in some ways it kind of knows that.
The effects are pretty enjoyable, like almost similar to Jurassic Park. Mila Jovovich and Tony Jaa do play off each other quite well, and both are really at action. Ron Perlman is also good in his supporting role. I never played the game in which this is based, but i'm sure it's every bit has entertaining."
"""Minari"" is one heartfelt touching family drama of love and wisdom as a viewer sees how being together grows a family strong no matter what kind of cards are dealt their way. Set in the early 80's a Korean American family has moved from the hustle and hassle world of California to the rural south to an Arkansas farm for a chance at the American dream, as new roots of goals and life have been planted. Jacob(the good Steven Yeun) and Monica(Yeri Han) want to break from their 9 to 5 life of working at a chicken factory so Jacob invest in the earth and land and equipment to start planting seeds to grow harvest so he can become a fine farmer. Their two small kids David(Alan S. Kim who's so cute) and Anne(Noel Cho) have to adjust to a new school and life that involves church too. And things do twist and spin even more when their stubborn and go against the grain rule breaking grandmother Soonja(Yuh-Jung-Youn) arrives. Grandma is loving and caring though and she brings a little seed of magic and hope to the Arkansas farm! Challenges and ups and downs are common still thru it all this picture shows that at home if a family has love, togetherness, with hard work and determination they will last no matter what happens. Overall wonderful film that one will love watching as they see a strong masterful family."
"First off, this movie is subtitled; but don't let that make you miss this movie. A Korean family living in California in the 1980s moves to Arkansas for the rich soil. Patriarch of the family Jacob (Steven Yeun) wants more than life to be a farmer. His wife Monica (Yeri Han) and children have experienced culture shock and disappointment as they try to get accustomed with the ""hillbilly"" form of life..Husband and wife get jobs ""sexing"" young chickens, because the males are considered worthless. Jacob spends every spare moment trying to grow the biggest garden possible. Be on the watch for Alan S. Kim, who plays young David.Let me stop to not spoil this wonderful film. Beautiful scenery and characters build before your eyes."
"It's 1983. Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to rural Arkansas where the father dreams of growing Korean vegetables and grab a piece of the American dream. His wife has massive doubts. The couple works hard sexing chicks. Their son has heart problems. The wife's mother arrives to take care of the kids. The family is befriended by religious fanatic Paul. It's a struggle on many fronts.It's the classic immigrant struggle and it's as compelling as ever. It feels real. It feels personal. It just feels. It's a movie with all the feelings. It's funny, sad, intense, and light-hearted. All the performances are great and they all feel real."
"What is it about subtitles informing us, ""Chicken clucking; Chicken squawking"". Really helpful!
Five stars for expressing the theme of female empowerment, and the critical thought that family honor should not determine a young girl's future. That equality not servitude should be the norm. That girl's should not be molded to be a good wife by having to show obedience, elegance, politeness, poise, gracefulness, and to serve her husband in silence.
One star for the poor flying wire scenes & camera edited, not realistic, fight scenes, & Mulan suddenly wearing lots of makeup with flowing hair when she exposes herself as a female. One star for Disney kowtowing to gain Chinese viewers by appeasing Chinese censorship in promoting obedience to the Emperor (Xi Jinping), and his dynasty (the CCP crackdown on individual freedom)."
"""In the much coveted role as Mulan, a cool, calm and collected Liu Yifei serviceably passes off as a virtuosic warrior with her well-trained gymnastic prowess (beautifully captured by the tired slo-mo treatment), but as so often she must conceal her comely femininity under a facile mannish comportment, she seems to err on the side of also bottling up Mulan's emotions, which leaves any inward outputting border on minimum, and the story of MULAN is actually very emotional (a baptism of fire experience about warfare, self-identity and defiance), but Liu mainly puts on a brave face and plows on without telegraphing much inner fluctuation, that is a major letdown.""reading the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
"It's curious that this film has been rated 15 - most of the intended audience must surely be younger than that! The premiss is that Blu Hunt (""Danni"") wakes up in an institution where she is told that she has mutant powers and is being cared for until she can master them safely. Along with four other patients/inmates she slowly comes to realise that this is more of a prison than an hospital and the initially suspicious and antagonistic group start to bond. Maybe what makes this stand out is the fact that a Marvel adventure openly, and rather understatedly, depicts a same sex attraction between the heroine and Maisie Williams ""Rahne"" (pronounced rain) but otherwise it's a pretty lacklustre, character free 90 minutes with great special effects but little, if any, menace after an extraordinarily long build up. Clearly teed up for a sequel, let's hope they spend more time developing their personalities next time."
"Greetings from Lithuania.I enjoyed ""The New Mutants"" (2020) more then I thought I will be. Don't get me wrong - this isn't a great movie, and I enjoyed it mostly as a guilty pleasure. It had a nice plot that was mysterious and pretty spooky at the moments. It kept me guessing and I enjoyed it. This flick was also pretty nicely paced as at its running time 1 h 34 min it barely dragged. Performances were pretty descent by Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams - given the material. Unfortunately Blu Hunt wasn't that good.Overall, with lesser budget and a new direction this series took with this movie, I enjoyed ""The New Mutants"" as guilty pleasure way much more then lets say a terrible ""Dark Phoenix"". This spin off has a potential, but needs to be updated if they want to continue with it."
"GREENLAND is the latest Hollywood disaster movie about a world-ending comet striking the Earth and mankind doing their best to avoid it. It goes for a more realistic approach than many; no silly attempts to ward off the disaster here, just people scurrying for safety in one of the few places on the planet that'll protect them. It's a lower budget movie than expected, with just a couple of CGI bits, but in many ways that makes it a tighter and more realistic thriller. The main thrust of the story is about efforts to keep the nuclear family together despite the odds. Gerard Butler is an actor I like and a good lead in this, but the rest of the cast is pretty poor. It's nothing new but it has a good pace to make it quite watchable."
"Or World War S for SUCKS, STUPID DECISIONS and SYFY-ENVY.I'm not ready to call it, but I think Covld's killing cinema. I hated this movie. Like unbelievably hated it. And speaking of unbelievable, this movie's parents, 1998's Deep Impact and Armageddon, had enormously better special effects and those was decades ago.Mercifully, I only spent $3.99 on this rental, which coincidentally enough, was about half its budget. Still, I overpaid for this lazy, boring, unemotional mess of two actors sleepwalking through it and a kid who's more bipolar than Harvey Dent.This disaster film deals with every...single...cliché but done without depth. Regardless, I suppose you're supposed to feel for the, of course, divorced parents of a diabetic child and their boring journey to the Title because a comet is set to destroy Planet Earth!I can't even comprehend the plot holes, predictable actions, the annoying characters, the needless sacrifices and the most amateur filmmaking since Battlefield Earth. And it really hurts that it's 2 hours of blah with stars who just didn't give a damn and about 3 minutes of action that's so comically cartoonish and based in no reality, it should never be called an ""Action Movie"" despite having Gerard Butler's name attached.I hate to say this, but if you find one of those Bruce Willis sell-out movies where he appears for 2 minutes of screen time and gets a check for having that top billing, you're probably better off watching that.SKIP THIS DISASTER."
"Greenland has a grand setting and engages enough, but lacks substance.The end of the world will bring anyone together, one minute it's awkward, the next together forever. Don't forget there's always crazies out there. It's like a small portion of ""War of the Worlds,"" really. At the start with the other families at their get together, everyone there knows they're the only ones selected. I don't believe them going to check for a second, leaving the Garrity's to pack, so they can then react, very convenient. Would have been much tougher had they not voluntarily left the house and had to pack with them there. I don't understand the anger though, seems like a civilized conversation. They know his profession and why's he's been selected, he didn't have a say, seems petty. The characterization's rather thin and performances not particularly memorable, but it's alright."
"It's been a while since I've seen a good comet disaster movie, so I was looking forward to 'Greenland'.Fortunately, 'Greenland' did not disappoint. The film is not as action-packed as 'Armageddon', since it focused more on the drama surrounding the disaster. The film also illustrated people's behavior during disaster, and the dire consequences of their actions, and humanity's inability to work together when disaster strikes.Within the first few minutes the film hit us with an overdone cliche: a disaster movie featuring yet another couple with marital problems who will - no doubt - be reunited due to the disaster. Fortunately, the rest of the film was not as cliched and a great depiction of human greed and selfishness.The suspense is elevated by our hero, John's son Nathan, who is diabetic. John and his wife, Allison, and son has been selected to be taken to an underground shelter. However, just before boarding the plane, Nathan forgets his insulin in the car. This sets off a series of events that throws their lives - and chances of survival - into turmoil. Thanks to good performances, this film felt realistic, and there's some excellent scenes of comet debris crashing to earth. 'Greenland' is an easy watch with a simple premise and no surprise twists.And who is to say this can't - or won't - happen?Would I watch it again? Possibly."
"For me to like a movie I ask myself some questions. Was I entertained? Was the cinematography of good quality? Were the actors doing a decent job? Was the story somewhat enjoyable to watch? On all of these questions above I have to answer yes. My wife wasn't that thrilled about Enola Holmes, rating it a six, just because the main character was talking directly to us, the audience, but I on the other hand thought that was a clever thing to do to tell her story. Millie Bobby Brown, well known since the brilliant series Stranger Things, is definitely an actress that we will see a lot in the future. Don't forget she's still only 15 while playing Enola Holmes, and the least we can say is that she's very convincing as an actress, very enjoyable to watch. No doubt she will become easy on the eye once she will grow up, so I can see a bright future in good movies for her. The rest of the cast did also a good job playing their respective characters. Henry Cavill is an actor that plays in good production and there's a reason for that. Enola Holmes is easy entertainment, just the kind I needed at this moment."
"A group of terrorists take over a flight, unaware that a mother, travelling with her son, is a vampire and will do all that is necessary to protect him.This starts off quite well during the initial hijacking when the film is geared around the terrorists and the vampire sneaking around the plane taking them out. Things get a touch OTT when people start getting bitten and in turn becomes vampires. This is ok fun with buckets of blood, but it's too long, the kid is annoying and the frequent flashbacks showing how the woman became a vampire rather a dull diversion and quite unnecessary. Ok, sort of."
"Honestly, if all hijacking-depiction movies/series end this way, They'd be in big trouble (all characters involved).Nevertheless, a great movie with very good acting by all the cast, full of basic instincts & emotions (especially Elias and Nadja), realistic creatures' movements, suspenseful score and an amazing flow. Had it not been for some dismal technical/physics big ""holes"" destroying the logic of events, it would have surpassed many productions out there and would have been one of the truly unique productions in the genre as depicted in that confined space.So, summing it up, a very nice try for that budget, huge effort put in by all the cast and crew (Netflix Europe/Germany section) and above all, 2 hours of thrilling entertainment, nearly glued to your seat.Well done and expect more high-level productions from them, hopefully with bigger allocated budgets. Roll on...Screenplay/story: 7Direction/development: 9Realism: 9Entertainment: 9Acting: 9.2Cinematography/filming: 9Visuals/special effects: 9.4Sound/score: 8.5Depth: 8Logic: 4Flow: 8.8Horror/thrill: 8.5Ending: 7."
"I tried to watch it all the way through, but I got the gist of it within ten minutes. The story is lacking any sort of purpose other than blood and gore. The characters are flat, undeveloped and with no direction. This is basically a copy cat movie of all those other movies where you have either an elevator, island, a boat or a building with infected people getting killed off one at a time. It's completely predictable and boring."
"The last few vampire movies which i enjoyed were 30 Days of Night, Let me In n the low budget Prowl.This one really nailed it.It has ample amount of tension, suspense n brutal mayhem.The scene n the place where they show how the lead character got infected is atmospheric n i hope they show more on the father son story.But alas, the way they ended, left no room for a sequel.Hope at least a prequel.It was good to see Dominic Purcell aft a long time.This one has shades of Red Eye, Liam Neeson's Non-Stop n Snakes on a Plane."
"Pretty good movie, wasn't something special but this watchable before sleep, family friendly."
"Oh dear. Despite reshoots and a huge amount of publicity here in the UK, the negative reviews kept coming for this film. And sadly in my opinion they are deserved.I'm not saying that the Rex Harrison original, or the Eddie Murphy films based on 'Dr Doolittle' were such classics that the character should be retired, but surely they could've done better than this.I didn't mind Robert D.J, I thought he was good, I didn't mind the Welsh accent, or even the overcomplicated story.What lets this film down is that despite copying the Eddie Murphy films example of having funny people do the animals voices, they get people who aren't funny. Either that or the script doesn't allow them to be.Worst of the bunch by a mile has to be Kumail Nanjiani, who keeps getting these voice over sidekick roles (he also did MiB International) and is about as funny as he was there - not very.This film didn't deserve the kicking it deserved, but it should've been a lot better than it is."
"""Dolittle"" is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we watch a physician who has the ability of talking to animals going on a new adventure to find a legendary island with the help of his crew and a young boy.I enjoyed watching this movie but I believe that it didn't reach its potential or I had high expectations from it. I liked the interpretation of Robert Downey Jr. who played as Dr. John Dolittle and it was something extremely different than his previous roles. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Harry Collett's who played as Tommy Stubbins and he was very good at it. The direction which was made by Stephen Gaghan it was interesting but nothing more than this.Finally, I have to say that ""Dolittle"" is a good average movie to spend your time with but don't have high expectations from it because you are going to be let down by it."
This story is engaging and intense enough. The characters make you want to care about them.
"James Hansen (Liam Neeson) owns a ranch in Neco, Arizona on the border. He hasn't made any payments in six months and is surprised when the bank forecloses. The cartel is chasing a mother and child across the border and we all know the script from here.It seems all Liam Neeson films are anti-climatic since ""Taken.""

"This 2020 thriller stars Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen.
This begins with a woman, Diane (Paulson) giving birth to a baby that becomes incubated. Seventeen Years later, Diane is tending to her teenage daughter, Chloe (Allen) who is crippled. Soon, Chloe suspects that she's hiding something from her. This is a good, tense thriller that has a ""Misery"" vibe and both actresses are good in it. I recommend this if you're into psychological thrillers."
Run was a well acted thriller that had some very good psychological chills in it that were able to impress me in a sort of a way.Before watching this film i thought i will witness another cliched horror film with psychological drama that i saw a million times before but i was actually surprised by this film in a good way.Actresses give a very good job expecely Sarah Paulson who was very creeepy in some scenes and in end she did a god job.Kiera Allen is a actress that i dont know much about but she also did a good job.Run was a nice surprise for me and i was happy with it
"'Run' is a well crafted, tense thriller that hits you with shocking twist upon shocking twist.What happens when you suddenly don't trust your mom anymore, after she has lovingly taken care of you for 17 years? 'Run' explores this - with nail-biting suspense! This was creepy on a completely different level. The film's protagonist is Chloe, a paraplegic (excellently portrayed by real-life wheelchair bound actress Kiera Allen). Whenever a thriller features a character with a disability (or pregnant woman) the suspense is automatically elevated. 'Run' became more intense and suspenseful with every scene.Once the characters are set up, it doesn't take long before events take a turn for the worse, and Chloe realizes she's a prisoner within the confines of her own home. I don't want to do any spoilers, so I'm not going to delve too deep into the story. This is one of those movies where the ending couldn't come soon enough. Not because I didn't like it, but because it was so nerve wrecking that I could hardly contain my curiosity to see how it would end. Amazingly, the film simply never loses momentum. This is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, and one of the must-see films of 2020 (if you're into thrillers).Kiera Allan brilliantly carries the film, and Sarah Paulsen is superb as the mother, Diane. I thought 'Run' was excellent.Would I watch it again? Yes."

"This film start with a series of picture been projected, and a man ""George"" seeing blood dripping on his car's windshield scene! As turnout, this film is about George committed a series of crime, and eventually kill by the joined spirit of his wife, and the spirit in his house! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the taking bath scene, overuse of the vomit scene, overuse of the sleeping scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, and overuse of the smoking scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, George chopping his wife ""Catherine"" to death! At the end, George sailing to the sea of death! That's it! Wasting time to watch!"
Amanda is honestly so talented! The plot is great!
Quite Alrite with old movie concept with adding new elements. It's a bit long and horror part not that advanced. But still good with the storyline.
"8/10 - while I agree with other reviewers that the ending was a little underwhelming, this was all-in-all a captivating horror thriller that kept unraveling and peaking my curiosity."
2 out of 5 stars.Boring horror thriller film. Which the plot is boring and forgettable. Cast ensemble gave a tedious performance. Lacks thrills and horror. And the ending was a wtf moment that left you with no other thought about the movie.
Michael Rianda joins animation royalty (Brad Bird et al) with one of the sharpest scripts in years.
"It seemed boring, a family facing machines, the title sums it up and it doesn't help, but what a captivating family, it seems our family, maladjusted, crazy, but that everyone loves each other, special participation of that perfect, margarine commercial in the urge, but none surpasses ours, the adventures are wonderful, the perfect strips, super fun and exciting..."
"Kristen Stewart plays a mechanical engineer (first unbelievable part) on the deep water ""Kepler"" drilling station owned by TIAN. While brushing her teeth there is a hull breech and the film is in full action and survival mode. Not too hard to figure out (before she does) that there is something out there. They drilled too deep.For some reason it reminded me of Jaws 3D. There was no introduction of characters. We are introduced to the mining operation through news clips during the opening credits. It was weak. I would have rather have seen a group conversation over the issues while building character. Kristen Stewart spends part of film running around in poor lighting in bra and panties. She is no Jane Russell.Guide: 1 quick muttered F-word. No sex or nudity."
"I enjoy these types of movies. it wasn't anything special. but it was suspenseful and i enjoyed the experience. lots of cool moments and scary sequences. a good time overall (1 viewing, 9/19/2020)"
"I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It takes place entirely in the Mariana Trench, almost 7 miles deep and with water pressures of over 15,000 psi. Why would a crew be down there? To explore for oil, of course. The opening scene which summarizes all the risks pretty well summarizes what the movie is.The story doesn't try to explain anything about the undersea operation, shortly after the movie begins an Earthquake begins to cause cracks in the structure and the whole movie in essence is an escape saga, to see if the core group of 6 or 8 can scramble to safety.It is of course mostly improbable but as a horror B-movie is suitably entertaining. However not the type of movie I'd like to see again.An additional note, the soundtrack is a character in itself, containing much very deep bass, so anyone watching it at home must have a good sound system with a powered subwoofer to get full impact and enjoyment. I replayed a couple of scenes with only my TV speakers on and all the great sound disappeared. It is a dramatic difference."
"UNDERWATER is the latest ALIEN rip-off and another ""underwater base"" flick in the spirit of THE ABYSS and LEVIATHAN. Sadly, it's a distinctly average movie let down by a ton of murky underwater photography which is almost as boring as the lengthy undersea scenes in THUNDERBALL. You can't make out what's going on in these scenes apart from an overload of CGI and they're really disappointing. The rest is a predictable story with the usual disaster staples and sudden deaths, although it gets more interesting towards the climax. I'm a huge Lovecraft fan so I loved the main creature in this, although the human-size ones are too obviously ALIEN derived. Kristen Stewart is a poor choice for lead but Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel are better. UNDERWATER's okay, but you'd be better off sticking with LEVIATHAN for a more-fun movie."

"Sonic the Hedgehog - 3
Huh. This movie actually wasn't that bad. Sonic the Hedgehog borrows heavily from other buddy road trip movies we've seen, and some of the characters' decisions don't make sense, but this is a harmless film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Also, my kids really enjoyed it. And seeing has how most video game adaptations are terrible, that makes this film adaptation one of the better ones."
"Well it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The Sonic face was better it looked more similar with original game. The best part of movie are songs. Everything was a little bit too basic, jokes were lame, plot was meh."
"Well made movie all around. very funny and fun. great pacing and kept me invested throughout.i already said it was very funny, but i need to specifically talk about jim carrey and the pure gold that is every scene he's in. his first scene in the movie had me crying, no exaggeration. it wasn't that hysterical for the rest of his scenes, but when he wasn't hilarious, he was so awesomely over the top. a perfect role for him, and a perfect casting choice since i can't imagine anyone else making such an outlandish character believable. jim carrey, you are the GOAT (1 viewing, 5/10/2020)"
"Sonic the Hedgehog (Ben Schwartz) is a blue alien refugee on Earth. He's living in secret near the small town of Green Hills. Tom (James Marsden) is the town's friendly sheriff. When Sonic accidentally causes a power outage, the Pentagon calls up evil genius Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).The Sonic redesign is good. This is mostly fun. Jim Carrey is very weird which somewhat fits. I like Sonic and I like his chemistry with Marsden. I like the family. It's all somewhat good but nothing great. It doesn't have much of a plot. The last act is not that great. That makes this a good video game movie."
"The film is part of a certain genre of lovable alien coming to Earth and being chased by unnecessarily evil and ineffective power hungry guys while being protected by regular people for emotional reasons. It checks all the boxes, it is funny and pleasant, too. The villain, while being the usual cardboard evil character, gets much more nuanced and interesting from Jim Carrey's performance. And frankly, I thought James Marsden was just a pretty face, but I kind of like him in everything he does so, good luck James!As a successful and fun to watch movie based on a game - they are too few and far between - I think this is way above the average. Maybe a bit too childish, though, but I guess this film isn't for adults."
"DreamWorks will forever be my favorite studio for now on, Disney showed it's TRUE self during the pandemic didnt release anything we could see in the theater and only caved and released them but on THEIR disney streaming service. I will NEVER go to a disney movie again!! But DreamWorks gave us a phenomenal film it was full of adventure, comedy, had tension incredible animation and above all gave us something to see in the theater. I went twice to the theater and purchased the 3d bluray!! I will buy any DreamWorks bluray that is released and will see every film they release in the theater!!!! THANK YOU DREAMWORKS!!!!!!!!!"
"(3.5 out of 5 stars).The Croods is a pretty fair family adventure film. Following the Croods next adventure as they are trying to find there forever tomorrow home which they call it. But when they come across a giant walled utopia. With food everywhere. And an oasis river. They run into another family that calls themselves the Bettermans family. Which they know Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) family before they passed away. The Bettermans try to have Guy fall for there daughter while Grug (Nicholas Cage) makes a deal with them since he is disliking the idea his daughter Eve wants to start a life with Guy. While the Bettermans are holding a secret about there perfect home.The plot is pretty decent. The Croods are living a different lifestyle with the Bettermans. While they are trying to handle the Croods lifestyle. Grug is having trouble letting go his daughter is growing up. The story is not as strong as the original but still fun for the whole family.The animation, visuals, and soundtrack are fun. And good. The direction with Croods mother and Eve and grandmother teaming with Bettermans mother and daughter to go save the guys was a little cheesy as it tries for that punk rock star tone. The humor is fun. The animation is colorful. And plenty of adventurous action."
"One of the first prehistoric families sets out searching of a safer place to call home. When they think they have found paradise, another family, the Bettermans, already lives there. Beautiful elaborate tree house with acres of fresh produce, plenty of fresh water and scores of amazing inventions. It won't take long for tensions to escalate between the two families. Full family fun and beautiful choreography.This animated film features the voices of: Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Kelly Marie Tran, Catherine Kenner, Joel Crawford and Peter Dinkladge."

"This film feels like Ferris Bueller joins the army. Then gets discharged and becomes a junkie. It has a quirky first-person narrative throughout the film with clever film editing and a added love interest for Bueller, cough Cherry (Tom Holland)."
"Russo Brothers trying out new stuff after the MCU. The story is about the life of Cherry: his love life, military life, post-military life, and his demise.The first part of the movie was the weakest. It was loaded with voice over, breaking the fourth wall, and other styles that was meant to engage the audience. Even though I didn't mind them really much, I agreed that these stylistic choices were just there for the sake of substances. They didn't do much to enhance the meaning or themes of the movie.However, the second and third arcs became significantly better. They showed Cherry's life in the military and his use of drugs. Even though the plot type was done countless times before, I thought the Russo's brothers' execution was great. The third arc had a big Requiem for a Dream vibe, and it was pretty hard for me to watch some of the scenes.Tom Holland was marvelous at his role and he sold his character very well. At around the second and third arcs, he became much more serious and this is where he shined the most.Even though the movie was almost 2.5 hours, I didn't feel it was too long and I was hooked into the story. However, I wouldn't watch the movie again because of the length.Overall, an entertaining yet bit rough to watch at times. Quite a roller coaster. 8.5/10"
"Second movie in a row for me featuring Tom Holland. After Chaos Walking, that was quite enjoyable to me as a fantasy movie and that despite the low ratings it got, this time Cherry, a powerful movie about PTSD but mostly about addiction, heroin addiction to be more precise. Not as powerful as The Basketball Diaries but certainly good enough to keep you far away from heroin after watching it. Tom Holland just nailed it here, very good performance playing his character. Ciara Bravo also did a good job. The destructive relationship they are in, the issues that both have, it's all well filmed and keeps you interested in the entire story. A long movie but never boring. Good to excellent cinematography, great cast, great story, what else can you ask for? Again an underrated movie with Tom Holland."
"Andy (Charlize Theron) short for Andromeda, the Andromeda leads a group of near immortals on select missions to save lives and eat baklava. Andy says they don't do repeats, but if you watched ""6 Underground"" you know Netflix does. They go on a mission to Sudan for Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor ) which was a set-up. Copley suspects the groups power and want to turn them over to Merrick Pharma. Rather than approach them with a proposal, he opts to gun them all down and make up later. This scenario didn't make any sense at all.This looks like a two hour pilot for a series that promises to be better. And they have the ability to drop people out and bring new ones in.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"Conceptually very strong, loved the characters and they have great chemistry. However, there's so much information trying to be conveyed that the main storyline gets lost. This would make for a great series but it's too much for a 2 hr movie. But great acting and the action choreography is intense."
"It was interesting, I would even say something unique. Plot has some action,some adventures and history moments. Not sure about that plot hole when someone betrayals, it just doesn't make sense and lower quality of whole film. I would recommend to watch this movie for action lovers, I found it similar to Suicide Squad."
4 out of 5 stars.The second film was a bit of a letdown with its uneven direction. The third film does end the trilogy in a good slow direction that picks up in a bloody showdown third act. The film takes the characters back in 1666 to give an origin story of the witch. When a village of settlers in the town. Gets cursed and people starts pointing accusations towards girls who seem out of place. Without giving away spoilers. There is a twist which turns the film direction into a bloody third act. Where a few teens try to hold up in a place to face against a variety of killers while trying to kill the evil.Plot is good. The cast ensemble is good. It took awhile to get used to the same cast playing different characters in 1666 which felt weird at first. Especially the accents they were using. But the story keeps you engaged. The thrills is good. And the third act is bloody entertaining. The film holds back a soundtrack with spending more time on a music score.The film does give it a proper conclusion. While leaving a mid credit scene for more possibilities.
"The third and final installment, here we get to learn how and why Sarah Fier came to be.It's a pretty good film, good to see members of the cast mixed up, and given something better to do. Better than the first, perhaps not as good as the second. It's a worthy conclusion, and gives us lots of answers.Some great production values here, great buildings, and some fantastic costumes.One gripe I have here, the shocking accents, it was hard to tell if they were trying to be Irish, Canadian or something a little more obscure.Perhaps the single best scene of the three movies comes here, the moment of terror inside the church with The Pastor, it was incredibly macabre and unnerving, it certainly did shock.Enjoyed it, 7/10."
"""Fear Street: 1666"" is a Mystery - Horror movie and the third movie of the ""Fear Street"" franchise, in which we continue our journey in the past. We are now back on 1666 and we watch how all started and how the curse of Sarah Fier released.I enjoyed the third movie of this franchise the same way as the previous two. The plot continued to surprise me since there were some plot twists that I did not expect and made the movie even more interesting. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak who made also the direction for the previous two movies followed the same successful way. The interpretations of Kiana Madeira who played as Sarah Fier / Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Henry / Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Lizzie / Kate and Olivia Scott Welch who played as Hannah Miller / Samantha Fraser were for one more time very good. All in all, I have to say that ""Fear Street: 1666"" and ""Fear Street"" franchise was simply amazing and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it. I am sure that if you are a horror movies fan you will simply love this franchise."
"Which is an extraordinary achievement even in today's upside down world. The first in the trilogy was so good I sat through the second and third, parts of my life I will never get back. Whichever exec greenlighted this disaster should find a new line of work."

"The first thing I want to write is - unless you watched and enjoyed the prior ""Bill and Ted"" movies then you really ought to skip this one. While it is silly and juvenile it is done in such a winning manner that it is totally enjoyable.The first ""Bill and Ted"" movie came out in 1989 when the two were in their 20s but acting like high schoolers. Now mature in their 50s they each have a 20-something child, daughters, who identify with their dads and get into the time travel mode to help save the world yet again.I enjoyed it, on DVD from my public library. My wife skipped, as I suspected she would."
"I had only seen the first one, but I saw a review of the second one. Yes, it was the Nostalgia Critic who showed me that one. Anyway, this movie features Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter reprising their roles decades after the first movie. That deserves credit by itself. The plot features Bill and Ted saying that at 7:17pm of this night, they have to write the perfect song or else time will be destroyed. They go to themselves in the future when they make the perfect song.Like the first one, this relies mostly on creativity as its strong point. It really seemed like this didn't have that much on comedy as the other ones. It's still enjoyable, because it gets very creative. I will admit that it did get a little boring at times and even for a movie that's an hour and a half, it could have been shorter. The characters (and actors) are still likeable, which is another strong point. I'm so glad to finally see a new movie released in theaters since ""Sonic The Hedgehog: The Movie""! ***"
"This was an awful attempt to sequelise a franchise that had run its course in the early 1990s. I mean, it's nice to see Winter and Reeves in their iconic roles after all these years, but time hasn't been kind to this series and Reeves in particular seems awkward and uncomfortable. If they're cringeworthy, so too are the new cast members: hip young females who embarrass throughout, particularly the actress playing Reeves' daughter whose acting is pure caricature rather than performance. The rest is an overload of cheap CGI, story elements borrowed from the earlier films, and a random ending. Poor show indeed."
"As entertainment I thought Greyhound was slightly better than 1917 for example. There's more suspense in this movie than in the Oscar winning war movie from last year. That said Greyhound is sometimes a bit repetitive without being boring though. If you're like me not a big fan of wild waters and the open sea then Greyhound will be more effective, there will be more suspense as the naval battles are quite impressive. Tom Hanks did another good job with his character, he's a guarantee for success. I'm still waiting to see a bad movie with Tom Hanks. The CGI's were well done and added to the suspense. I wished they would have filmed the German side as well, in the submarine for example. I think that was a missed opportunity that would have made this movie even better. But I'm not going to complain, Greyhound was entertaining for me. If you like movies like Das Boot give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed."
"There is a superb book written by Rear-Adm. WS Chalmers that describes, in considerable detail, the career of Adm. Sir Max Horton - the man who ended up commanding what was known (in the UK) as the Western Approaches - the crucial lifeline between the UK and her supply chains from across the world. Tom Hanks (""Capt. Krause"") is the captain of one such lifeline leading, for his first time, a convoy across the Atlantic with just three warships to combat the increasingly effective Nazi U-boat ""wolf pack"" strategy that enabled the torpedoing of the freighters in a coherent and effective manner. Hanks carries much of this film en seul; his efforts as the officer juggling the responsibilities of keeping his fleet safe whilst combatting the atrocious conditions the ocean has to throw at them result in a strongly delivered character in whom we can all too readily believe. Some of the visual effects are top drawer, too - particularly towards the end when the battle lines are drawn and engagement with the enemy provides us with an enthralling sense of suspense and jeopardy. Some of the battle effects are little too ""Battleships"" at times, but they do contribute well to the overall and effective sense of peril that was faced by these young, inexperienced, seamen on mission after mission. Aaron Schneider (and Hanks with his writing hat on) have done a good job immortalising in film what CS Forester had already, poignantly, written."
"Greyhound (4 out of 5 stars).Greyhound is a good war film that follows Captain Krause (Tom Hanks) as his ship escorts a group of cargo ships during WWII. Which they come across a nazi submarine that plays cat and mouse with them. As they battle to survive.This film is very fast paced. With very little to none on the character and story development. Occasionally having Krause having flashbacks of his wife played by Elizabeth Shue. The film is non stop action which you may have to buckle up for this wild ride. The plot is good. About Krause captaining Greyhound ship and trying to escort others.The direction does deliver a chaotic battle sequence. Putting you right in the crew's perspective with the action. As they see a sub ascending with a torpedo coming towards them or seeing a ship flashed from an explosion. The action is big, loud, and chaotic which you have to see on the big screen. The music score was great as it created that intense feeling and mood when a threat is near.I was a little disappointed with Tom Hanks script which did not have any character development or characterization with anyone. The script is consist of crew members yelling out orders or demands on the ships actions. Which was thin and lacking for about anything else for a war movie.But it was one wild ride that will have you on the edge of your seat."
"What a beautiful, moving story and film, and acting....I was stunned by this feature, and I realized that it was real good for mental health to discover such gems from time to time. That's unfortunately not the kind of film that audiences in theaters will come to see, at least not the bulk audiences. There is not real love interest here, not as in other films, I mean. This is a so sensitive and poignant story, so unexpected story telling. Thanks Netflix for having released this movie."

"It's 1939 Suffolk, England. Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) hires local archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to dig some mysterious mounts of earth on her property. He sees the potential for an unprecedented Anglo-Saxon find. When he makes a big discovery, prominent archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives to take over the dig. He brings in married couple Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin) and Peggy Piggott (Lily James). Edith calls in her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to help.This starts slowly as a two star vehicle. I didn't see much potential for great drama. It seems like a small quiet English indie and that would be fine. Quite frankly, the whole cast hasn't even shown up yet. That small story does slowly become more. It becomes a romantic melodrama, an emotional tragedy, a family drama, and a war epic. I think the moment that Lily James shows up is when the movie announces that this movie wants to be bigger. Everybody is performing together to form the story into a beautiful ball of twine."
"Based on a true story, Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes ) is hired by Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to do an archeological dig on some hills of dirt near her home. Edith is ill and has a son Robert who wants to help.If you read the by-line you know what they discover. They create a little drama around it. But hey, it is all about folks digging in dirt. I can't believe they did this film without Keira Knightley.Guide: Brief sex. No swearing or nudity."
"My ratings are not objective. This movie is objectively fine. My ratings are subjective opinions. My opinion is this is one of the most boring movies ever.There is about 30 minutes worth of story in this 2 hour movie. Say another 30 minutes for character development. The rest is nothingness. I almost quit a bunch of times. I watched it on fast speed, at most 2x during scenes with talking. But other times i had it at 5x speed and didn't miss a thing. That's how nothing this movie is.

"You'd get an ordinary movie seems to be the answer. It's certainly an odd reference to Superman--perhaps the strangest since DC's most beloved family farmers unexpectedly seemed to turn up in the Marvel movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009). Seems weirder to me than even ""Brightburn"" (2019). That what appears to be the most remarkable thing about a production is that it casts the same duo, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, who played Superman's adoptive parents in the latest DC cinematic incarnations, ""Man of Steel"" (2013) and so on, is an indication that not much interesting is going on here. It also seems perhaps inadvertently in poor taste that the son this time dies from falling off a horse, as I couldn't help but recall the similar tragedy that paralyzed the late Christopher Reeve, who of course also played Superman at one time.Supermans aside, though, ""Let Him Go"" is a simple neo-Western revenge tale where the Kents--I mean, Blackledges set out to rescue their grandson after his abusive stepfather scuttles him and his mother off to North Dakota. Well acted, well plotted, scenic, and that's about it. There just isn't much going on in this superficial ""The Searchers"" (1956) retread--even if it is a period piece that covers issues of domestic abuse and mistreatment of Native Americans. Leslie Manville evidently relishing her role as the baddie is the highlight."
"LET HIM GO (2020) ***1/2 Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Lesley Manville, Kayli Carter, Booboo Stewart, Jeffrey Donovan. Still waters run deep while family matters is the crux of this lean and mean low-key slow burn drama cum Western vengeance with Costner and Lane as grandparents to a boy now with a 2nd yet shady rural family led by malevolent matriarch Manville (with her Cruella DeVille do to boot). With its smudged pallet of bruised brown and blue-greys by cinematographer Guy Godfree and a steady helm by director Thomas Bezucha - adapting Larry Watson's novel - makes a potboiler of taut tension a work of art."
"Former lawman George Blackledge (Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret (Diane Lane) suffer a great loss when their son die in an accident. Their daughter-in-law Lorna, with their grandson Jimmy, remarries to Donnie Weboy. The couple leaves town without telling the Blackledges. Margaret is desperate to find them. The Blackledges track them back to the Weboy family home run by commanding matriarch Blanche.The first half works like a horror movie. It's building up to an epic meeting. It could have stayed in the horror lane. It may be the better move. Instead, I have to question some of what the Blackledges are doing. They are escalating the situation. I don't mind turning it into a family feud. I would not try to force rooting interest into this fight. If it's kept a horror, this would be a lot simpler. As a Greek tragedy, it works better if both sides are more equal in responsibility. It would make Blanche's final question more poignant. I would also question what the police would do after the movie ends. They are dragging poor Peter into this mess. I'm sure the police would be coming after him even if they don't mess with the white women."
"I don't have anything specific i hated about this movie. It just didn't do anything for me. It did a bad job of getting me invested in the story or the characters. The parts that are supposed to be intense didn't make me feel the stakes or any kind of suspense. The longer the movie went on, the less i cared about what happens in the story or to the characters. And the action is mediocre.Actually i do have a specific complaint. So many parts of the movie are sloppy in the sense that the viewer is not sure what's happening in a scene. I'm not talking about shaky-cam/quick-cut fight scenes. They just did a bad job of producing a continuous flow that a viewer can follow. And a lot of the scenes were so dark. On more than one occasion i didn't know who was fighting who or which character was shot. No wonder i stopped caring. Fail.I came back after finishing the review because i remembered a couple more things. Maybe i just checked out early causing me to forget. But the dialogue is atrocious. And there is an ""ah ha"" moment that makes zero sense. To keep it vague, it's okay if a specific person dies. But logically, it wouldn't make any difference based on what they're trying to avoid (1 viewing, 8/8/2021)"
"I'll take it on faith from John Clancy fans that this film had very little to do with the book of the same name, except for the names of principal characters. My fault with the film is the obtuse writing and as at least one reviewer pointed out, scenes so dark you can't tell what happened in them, only to find out later in the story. It pretty much boils down to operatives in both the CIA and it's Russian counterpart attempting to foment war with the other side, for reasons not really made clear except to keep tensions among the world powers going. Soldier John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) comes to that realization when he eventually meets up with his Russian opposite Rykov (Brett Gelman), who had a much better handle on the state of affairs between their respective agencies. The story is wrapped around Kelly's need to seek vengeance for the murder of his wife (Lauren London) and unborn child, but the revenge motive tends to get buried in the confusing story line along the way. I don't think a second viewing would clear things up all that much."
"""Without Remorse"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a United States Navy SEAL seeking revenge for the death of his wife. As soon as he starts searching more about it he finds himself into a large conspiracy that will affect everyone's lives.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it had some plot twists that made it interesting. The direction which was made by Stefano Sollima, it was very good and he presented very well his main character, his thoughts and his dreams. The interpretation of Michael B. Jordan who played as John Kelly was very good and he did an excellent job at his part. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jodie Turner-Smith's who played as Karen Greer, Guy Pearce's who played as Secretary Clay and Jamie Bell's who played as Robert Ritter. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Without Remorse"" is a simple, interesting, action movie that is good to spend your time with, if you have high expectations from it then I advise you to lower them."
"7/10 - while I am by no means a Pete Davidson fan, I couldn't help but appreciate the brutal honesty in this often-funny semi-autographical dramedy"
"Having seen Judd Apatow's previous directed films and knowing his type of comedic humor, and after seeing the trailer of this film, had somewhat an expectation as what to expect.The King of Staten Island is quite apparently a semi autobiographical film about the upcomings of Pete Davidson's life. With that in mind, it was expected as he would deliver a great performance as this film may have a deep meaning to him.With an original intended theatrical release, this film was unfortunately slated to straight to streaming. Perhaps they could have waited several months later to release this in theaters- as it would have don't more justice.As a film, very solid doses of comedy and drama which Apatow is always great at. There are many light hearted funny scenes, but also sad and touching scenes. There is a good balance. And as a story there are enough little subplots to keep engaged all the way though start to finish.This is the film which may be responsible for Pete Davidson becoming a star, although with its limited release the question still remains. Perhaps in 2-3 years from now we will have our answer."
"Seriously Mr. Apatow... 136 minutes of ""too much filler, not enough substance""? This was way too long and way too slow. The only reason I didn't fall asleep, was Davidson's fine balance of pathos and humor throughout the film. His story was very relatable and he performed/portrayed it quite well. The supporting cast was great as well. Had this film been cut/edited down to approx 90 mins with better pacing, and some crazier and funnier moments, it would've been a real hit. Still, mad props to Davidson for telling his story so well. Too bad Apatow didn't write and direct it better."
"I would say it's very interesting movie to watch. Not too complicated to catch main idea and fallow plot. Still the ending wasn't strong part of this film. I'm still missing ending, it wasn't very clear."

"The Babysitter: Killer Queen: Two years after his clash with the Satanic Cult, Cole (Judah Lewis) is in High School. No one believes his tales of that night, Melanie (Emily Alyn Lind), wisely keeps quiet about the whole thing. Cole has to see the school therapist/nurse and his parents want to send him to a special school. His complicated relationship with Melanie continues, she now has a boyfriend, Jimmy (Maximilian Acevedo), but still invites Cole along to a lake party on Jimmy's uncles's boat. A new Satanic Cult emerges and along with the resurrected old team sacrifice a victim. Cole escapes from their clutches with the help of Pheobe (Jenny Ortega), a new bad ass girl in his class who has an Alice In Wonderland fixation. You get death by decapitation,real flamethrower, homemade flamethrower, boat hook, machete. There are some good in references to Cape Fear, Deliverance etc. Very much a slapstick comedy horror but there are some dark moments. Not up to the standard of the original (maybe too many wacky characters) but we get the origin stories of the original Cult and it's certainly worth watching. Directed and Co-Written by McG. On Netflix. 6/10."
"2017's The Babysitter remains one of the most unexpectedly entertaining Netflix Originals ever, given that it was co-written and directed by none other than hack-for-hire McG.And while this recently-released sequel doesn't match the original's inspired level of gory insanity, it is nevertheless a follow-up unafraid to go balls-to-the-wall in the pursuit of knowingly trashy thrills.As much as it's a totally ""unnecessary"" sequel, it arguably justifies its existence through its self-aware, goofy tone, and commitment to splashing the screen with as much ridiculous gore as possible."
"A sequel to the largely average film that nobody asked for, KILLER QUEEN sees the geeky hero from THE BABYSITTER once more subjected to the machinations of the members of a Satanic cult with bloodshed and murder in mind. It's an action-oriented narrative with tongue firmly in cheek, packed full of pop culture references and jokes and very little more besides. The characters are bland and one-dimensional, the jokes scatological, and the OTT death sequences surprisingly repetitive and tiresome, with every cast member seemingly getting a bucket of blood chucked in their face at some point in the movie."
"This is a gory teen slasher film. Some scenes are over the top bloody, but it manages to maintain a fun vibe."
"Genuinely funny, surprisingly heartfelt, and entertaining from beginning-end, Bad Boys For Life has to be one of the biggest surprises of the last few years. There's nothing quite like a throwback buddy-cop film, and Smith & Lawrence have once again proved to us that the franchise should be here to stay. Aside from a Fast & Furious style ridiculous twist and some hit or miss jokes, Bad Boys For Life is a thrilling action film that will surely lead to more sequels, for better or worse.7.7/10"
"This is one of the best third installments in a series I've ever seen. It was perfect. The right blend of nostalgia and old faces with fresh blood and modern technology. It was jam packed with action, touching moments, and laugh out loud humor. It was indescribably good. Lawrence and Smith have undeniable chemistry and make this movie flow seamlessly. This series was brought beautifully into the year 2020. I can't wait for more."

"Yes, we see on the news, infrequently, rage for whatever reason leading to someone going on a killing rampage. The problem is that this script/movie does what many do which shows a character (unfortunately usually female) unrealistically making no or poor decisions in order to make 90 min. of film violence.
Near the beginning our lead character is being followed & harassed and she stops at a gas/market station where the attendant is told of potential danger from the driver of the vehicle now also parked in front. The pursuer even tries to run over a man at the station. Neither the attendant nor our pursued female seem to have called the police; there's no indication of store security cameras being used along with traffic video. At that point I'm thinking it's a not too real made-up script."

"It was even worse than average. It had so may cons... First of all, it wasn't realistic at all. You can't just kill people, drive as you want and there won't be cops under you, come on. Another bad thing is visuals... well,when you see ""horror or action"" movie and some scenes look as fake as WWE RAW you know something is wrong with that. There are many plot holes. We still don't know why he killed those people at the beginning, who they were, what happened in his life that he is so ""unhinged"". Ending was bad. Cops can't chase him, no one can find him and mom kills guy with scissors... That's HUGE No from me, I would never recommend to spend your time watching this film."
"Surprisingly, 'Bloodshot (2020)' isn't bad. It's sometimes genuinely enjoyable in a camp kind of way, especially in its opening moments, and it's often rather entertaining even when it isn't, for all intents and purposes, all that great. There's some decent action (as well as some not-so-decent action, of course), the performances are all pretty much on point and the narrative does a lot more than you'd expect it to. The movie has a number of generic twists and turns that are somewhat interesting in their execution and its visual effects are often rather impressive (though, again, they often aren't). Sure, the piece is cheesy and outdated, but it's actually kind of fun. However, there's always this element of mediocrity present. Even when you're entertained, you're always aware of some issue. That, along with the fact that it's only ever so good in the first place, makes for an experience that rests somewhere between 'alright' and 'good enough'. It helps that Vin Diesel is just an inherently funny human being, a bit of a walking meme. His presence definitely elevates this, even if it's difficult to put your finger on why exactly that is. Ultimately, this is a decent flick that does exactly what it needs to without taking itself too seriously. It's not great, but it's better than you'd think it would be. 6/10"
"Unlike ""The Rhythm Section"" which was a more realistic tale of someone becoming a revenging superhero this script is straight out of comic book fantasy - no real here. We have a blood stream filled not with blood, but little alien looking nano spiders busily repairing every mishap, i.e. get an arm blown off; within seconds they have made you a new one (forget where all the minerals/calcium for bone, and organic materials for muscle, nerves, etc. came from). The usual formula bad/mad industrialist scientist out to make a load of money & sell his little nano buddies to the highest bidder. Worth eight stars only because the script was a little different & the CGI was fairly decent (although the now decade old grayish swirling stuff is still the main CGI du jour)."
"""Bloodshot"" is a poor collection of ""Universal Soldier"", ""Robcop"", ""Matrix"" and 'Memento"", among other films, that do not work well. The plot is absolutely predictable and it is possible to the viewer to foresee the story. Despite of the clichés, the viewer that is fan of Vin Diesel will certainly find the movie entertaining. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Bloodshot"""
"""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" is a Comedy - Music movie in which we watch two musicians having a dream representing their country Iceland at the world's biggest song competition, Eurovision Song Contest. They succeed on taking the chance to represent their country and now they have to prove to everyone that they can win.I liked this movie because it had a simple, nice and very funny plot combined very well with some romantic scenes. For one more time Will Ferrell who played as Lars Erickssong was simply hilarious and his interpretation was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rachel McAdams who played as Sigrit Ericksdottir, Dan Stevens who played as Alexander Lemtov and Pierce Brosnan who played as Erick Erickssong, and they were all simply amazing. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will like it and you will laugh a lot."
"This is way way better than I expected. It's fun and entertaining. It even brings tears to my eyes at the end, which is very unexpected! I really enjoyed it."
"This one is slow with very few violent scenes, nudity n sex.
A contract killer is able to implant her consciousness into the body of another person in order to carry out an assassination. The assassin is able to control the body of another person but is not able to control the minds of others. A big lol.
It has a wierd sex scene n bloody stabbings but gets tedious."
"Sci-fi is extremely rare in French cinema ,but Netflix lent a helping hand and presto ! An estimable work well acted by reliable Mélanie Laurent.Mélanie's fate,in the first part of the movie , may remind you of Ryan Reynolds' in the excellent ""buried ""(2010); what does it matter if Reynolds is buried alive in a coffin by a group of Irakis and if Laurent is locked up inside a cryogenic chamber with the highest technology? ;both try to communicate with the outside world , both are more and more anxious because their oxygen is running out ; and voices they get tell them to take it easy ,but actually makes them more terrified by the horrible fate which lies in store for them. Ryan 's got only a mobile phone ,Laurent has plenty of paraphernalia around her,but most of the time,it backfires against her : ""the charitable euthanasia"" trick almost verges on black humor .There's an unexpected twist halfway through which explains why the heroine is stuck in her chamber,followed by awesome pictures which pack a real wallop .The second part is not as gripping as the first one ,and there is a certain blandness infiltrates the story .But it's so rare to see French actors in sci-fi (too bad that Malik Zidi 's part is so small) that it's cause for celebration."
"05/12/2021 This is the lead-in description of the movie is, ""A woman who wakes in a cryogenic chamber with no recollection of how she got there, must find a way out before running out of air"". It's also the whole movie in a nutshell. I'll give it a middle-of-the-road 5 stars and let other viewers determine it's fate. Glad it's over."

"Claustrophobic... It reminded me of the wonderful ""Buried Alive"", a modern, utopian, technological and less dramatic version, perhaps due to excessive modernization we do not have enough empathy, as it was in ""Buried"" ... A terrorist attack sounds more plausible than experiments with cryogenics , even if that is already a reality... But it is still distressing, compenetrante, especially the second half where science fiction and drama externalize more intensely..."
3 out of 5 stars.Oxygen is a fair science fiction thriller film about Liz (Melanie Laurent) who wakes up in a cryo pod with no memory. No idea how she got there. And a defective pod that is limited on oxygen. While she tries to discover how she got there. And how she can escape it.What worked? The plot is decent which tried to keep a mystery. It gives a brief backstory on Liz. And some brief moments of the events that is happening before she got in the pod. There is a twist which was pretty neat. And shocking.Melanie Laurent did a good job with her performance.The music score was okay. Its claustrophobic direction was good.What did not work?The film was short with where it went. Spending the whole movie in a cryo pod. Which did get boring after a while. And it did get slow which was being short on thrills.
"If your willing to take a part viewing the world in different angle from a car seat then do it. if you are willing to torture your already exhausted brain then do it. if your willing to enter a metaphysical to be or not to be philosophical journey into nothingness then do it. if you are used to fall asleep when driving your car longer the 2 hours then dont.this film is for the feinschmaecker intelligencia, made for the stern and cultural reviewers to tear to pieces and then put it all together again in the eternal search of,'' what was this all about''??i give it a five for the acting and a very diverse filmography, the sound of music do leave a sense of cold uncertainty, and the rest were far too haiflaiing for the grumpy old man. its not a rewind."
"Although I was intrigued and interested by the whole story during the entire movie I can't say it is a good movie. It's much too confusing, you hope to get answers that you will never get and that's just not my idea of a good movie. It's just frustrating, certainly when you spend more than two hours trying to figure out what it's all about. That said if the story would have been explained correctly it could have been a good movie. The acting was really good, especially from Toni Collette which was my favorite. she has a smaller part but it reminded me of her character she played in the excellent series United States Of Tara. So it were not the actors that failed in this movie but the story and that's too bad because it had potential. I won't say I didn't enjoy most of the movie but for me there is a rule that a story has to be clear towards the end which is absolutely not the case here. I'm still wondering what I watched and probably never will get it."
"Avoid. Why? Because I felt uncomfortable, bored, confused, dumbfounded and in the end irritated. Who wants to feel that when watching a movie? You do? I do not.This movie is like almost all the other Charlie Kaufman movies: I do tend to feel incredibley UNcomfortable and confused and DEpressed and IRritated. Sometimes feeling miserable while watching a movie can be rewarding IF (and only if) the movie is really great, but it isnt...Not any good? I applaud Charlie Kaufman for trying. These kind of movies rarely get made and they are quite unique.Conclusion: I would recommend anyone unfamiliar with Charlie Kaufman to watch ""Adaptation"" instead of this incoherent story. ""Adaptation"" presented discomfort, emptiness, anxiety and depression in a really funny and sparkling way to watch. This movie however was too long winding and boring to stay interesting..."
The story gets increasingly more bizarre. There are no explanations or closures either. I honestly don't know what I watched.
"Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a professional assassin. She was an over-achiever, a drunk, and then a soldier. She is constantly battling her addiction. She got recruited by her superior Duke (John Malkovich) into the company. To his dismay, she continues to ask her victims questions before she kills them. Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is concerned. Ava returns to visit her family after an 8 year absence. Her sister Judy (Jess Weixler) is dating her ex Michael (Common). Her mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital for a minor heart attack.This has lots of big name actors. This needs to decide what it wants to be. It has all the elements of gritty personal drama and flashiness of an international murderous conglomerate. In one moment, it has some realism and in another, it has all the fighting gun action of the latest John Wick film. It hits me all at once in Saudi Arabia. I'm fine with the exaggerated fighting in the hotel room. I'm excited by her pretending to be the damsel in distress. Taking on a squad of heavily armed soldiers is just being unnecessarily over the top. They don't seem to know how serious to take this movie. It ends up being a B-movie with a lot of talent who are cashing in some cheques."
"Female assassin on the run, history of brutal kills, ex military, etc...the list goes on n there r many similar movies. But when u make a movie on a bad ass female assassin pls dont put family melodrama n cliches aft cliches. The hand to hand combat is not choreographed well, the film is devoid of tension n suspense n the worst is the piece of cake assasination plan.
Jessica Chastain aint convincing as an assassin.
As a fan of Colin Farrell, i got disappointed. Well, he is in good shape but the footage is very less.
So ther is a scene wher the character of Chastain is narrating her alcohol abuse n childhood stuff in a group therapy and jus when poor Tony's turn came to share, the camera cut off, how selfish man.
Gena Davis played an assassin in Long Kiss Goodnight n sad to see her in bad condition, very old n with those plastic surgery lips.
The woman who played Chastain's sis (she was ther in Teeth n It) has a very chubby face n poor ol John Malkovich talking as if he is wheezing but he does get to kick some ass."
"And we're back into the 90s again, sort of. We do have a female lead though. And I don't mind the very predictable structure that much (feel free to disagreee here). What I do mind is the execution of the action and the stunts. They are not bad, but they don't incite excitement either - not as much as they could.I do love Jessica Chastain, but her action hero ego does not come off as strong - not as strong as it is supposed to be. A shame almost, especially because a fight scene Malkovich has, seems more potent and lethal than most of the other stuff. And that is what an action movie should prioritize, shouldn't it? If you are more forgiving in that aspect, maybe the paper thin story will wring more out of this than for others. Or maybe just the fact that you have really good actors (overqualified some might say) in this ... whatever floats your boat"
"Talk about a slow burn of a movie ... some may read horror movie and think this will be just one jump scare after another ... and while there are some of those, this builds up! And in quite the original and weird fashion! The fear of living or being in your own appartment/house cannot be put into words. Well not accurately that is - which is why this is also a visual treat.A horror movie that has quite impact - or is able to, if you let it. Visually stunning and creepy as it can be. The pacing probably will be an issue for some, but it isn't for you, do it! Watch it - you should be able to tell, if you like this after the first 15 minutes or so. And you can watch it again and again - because while this is a horror movie on the surface, there is a lot more beneath it ..."
"Truly terrifying, mostly because Weekes has great skill at drawing out the terror and how psychically linked it is to deeply personal trauma and grief. It takes both the thorny politics of assimilation, of what is one's home or place in the world, along with the horror of the value of death balanced with life itself (and Weekes understands and communicates that the political is personal, visa versa, so on). But his real win here is in the casting of Dirisu and particularly Mosaku - he manages to channel the ambivalence and Trying to Remain Composed type (but not holding up well) very strongly, while Mosaku is one of those major talents who can say so much with a look or a stare. In any just or healthy cinematic landscape she would be working steadily in good stuff forever, and hopefully she does. This is not something to throw on unless you're in the mood for a heavy mood (this isn't a frivolous like Conjuring or Blumhouse rollercoaster jam), this is more akin to like the Devil's Backbone as far as being exceptionally creepy, helmed by an artist in full command of his craft, and that it's about something - not to mention the genius of the premise itself, which helps bypass the usual question in ghost stories of ""why don't they just leave?"" Easier said than done, it seems. Oh, and that one masked girl... Holy god."
"In this genre His House is a nice breath of fresh air, something different from the usual things we see. It's not all perfect but it's certainly good enough to entertain many fans of this genre, with creepy passages and decent horror scenes. The cinematography isn't bad with interesting camerawork at times. As for the acting I thought the two major characters played by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku were very believable in their roles. Good performances from both of them as well as from the rest of the cast. It isn't a movie I would watch again but it was certainly good enough to keep me entertained for the whole duration of the movie."
"Exploring themes of grief, trauma, immigration, assimilation, remorse & acceptance through a horror lens, His House is a haunting & harrowing depiction of the refugee experience and, in addition to capturing their inward & outward struggle in adjusting to new life in new place, also delivers as a thrilling & effective haunted house chiller.Written & directed by Remi Weekes, the film blends character drama & genre thrills into one finely layered narrative and holds nothing back when unleashing the terror that dwells within the walls of their new home. While there are times when the story becomes perplexing, everything adds up & makes sense once the full picture of the characters' backstory is revealed.The atmosphere within the rundown residence is palpably tense & often unsettling, and though Weekes relies on jump scares to frighten the viewers, most of them do work out in the film's favour. Wunmi Mosaku & Sope Dirisu play the young refugee couple seeking asylum after escaping their war-torn homeland, and they both chip in with performances that are credible, grounded & convincing.Overall, His House is a welcome entry in the world of horror and also marks a solid debut for Remi Weekes' directorial career. The proper care with which he sketches the characters' troubled past, vulnerable present & uncertain future, and brings it in sync with the immigrant issues gives his picture a relevant touch & relatable appeal. One of the better horror entries in Netflix canon, His House is certainly worth a shot."
"Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) discovers he has an illegitimate son in Queens who is to be his heir as his daughters can not rule by law. We first see the son (Jermaine Fowler) interviewing for a job with the son of one of the Duke Brothers (Trading Places). I am sure I missed some more homage stuff. Wesley Snipes plays the well dressed choreographed bad guy. The film is a who's who of black entertainment minus a few under contract to Netflix.The production was very funny. It speaks to woman's equality but not preachy and in that regard I wished they had developed the daughter more. The son was not what I expected. They had him as a techno geek and a small time ticket scalper, but neither one was ever used in the film. I would have expected some gut who was a street smart hustler, using those credentials to pass his tests.Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity."
"Now we've all come across sequels, or remakes - reimaginings or reversionings - and wondered why? Well, this has to be one of the worst in recent times. Eddie Murphy's father - the luckiest actor in the film, James Earl Jones, is dying - but before he goes to spend more of his Darth Vader money, he presents his successor with a son he didn't know he had, who lives in California. Off he goes to fetch this young man ""Lavelle"" (Jermaine Fowler) and his larger than life mother ""Mary"" (Leslie Jones), brings them back to meet his all-female family in his Kingdom of Zamunda and all hell - accompanied by some horrific musical parodies of just about everyone from Gladys Knight to Nile Rodgers, with a bit of John Legend and Prince desecrated too - breaks loose. To be fair to Fowler, he is a good looking lad with some bemused attitudinal charm (particularly at bath-time), and there are some wonderful facial expressions from JEJ as he awaits death/relief from his coffin, but the rest of this just misfires on a pretty much continuous basis. The first film was very much of it's time, and that time is well and truly past..."
It is not funny at all. I was bored out of my mind. The plot is silly and contrived. The only thing good is the beautiful costumes of the three princesses.
"Sure the trailer is misleading it's more of a drama/thriller with a few horror elements so if you want a full on horror this isn't it. Jonelle Monáe is magnificent throughout really gives an extraordinary performance! The bulk of the movie is about trying to escape a slavery colony with some mysterious aspects mixed in there.The cinematography is absolutely incredible, would've been nice to see in the theater but at home on Halloween with a 4K TV was good enough and watched with my sister Emily along with our dog Lucas that was all delightful! Quite satisfied with Antebellum the way it plays out and I'd recommend it to anyone that might appreciates the film for what it is!"
"This 2020 thriller tells about a female author/historian, Veronica (Janelle Monae) who finds herself experiencing traumatizing, racial slavery and tries to
solve a way to escape. This isn't bad, but could've been better in my opinion.
I like the score, Monae does a decent job and she's cute reminding me a bit of Kerry Washington (Django Unchained). The film has some dramatic, violent and tense moments. Give it a try only if you're into psychological thrillers or dramas."
"I'm glad I didn't read anything about this movie before watching it, and certainly not all those extremely negative reviews on here. I wouldn't read anything if I were you so you'll be as surprised as I was when the twists and turns unfolds. Because even if I was surprised and mostly sceptic in the beginning of the first turn I have to admit that was some clever writing from Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. I didn't see it coming at all and that's what makes it even better. I don't know why people have to compare it to the things that happen in real life now, it's pointless, it's a movie, nothing else, but a pretty good one. The acting was very good from the whole cast, the directing and cinematography on top, and the story surprising, engaging, and mysterious. One of the better movies I've seen in a long time and I watch two to three movies every day. You could compare it to Get Out for the theme, but it's a totally different story, so I wouldn't."
"If you compare this movie to the original it will feel less unique and may seem more deja vu. Of course it's a a chase movie with zombies. In that sense it has a Terminator feel. Things start off with an interesting premise - go back to get the cash since Zombies don't want money. Some faults. One thing I didn't like was the game where they fed humans to the zombies. Unnecessary. Also making them fight other bad humans was irritating. A lot of the movie is at night.
The good points are the ending wasn't irritating. No one likes too much self sacrifice. Kang Dong Won looks quite suitable in this role surprisingly. In the past he seemed not quite hero looking for action but here he is good. Lee Jung Hyun is quite a good heroine too.
Okay for what it is. More conventional and less unique than the first movie. I prefer #Alive. But still an entertaining enough watch."
"While it is marketed as Train to Busan 2 and generally the promotion, I reckon especially internationally, tries to enamour people to watch this, it does a bit of a disservice to the movie. Yes this is losely connected to Train to Busan, as it plays years after that event (mostly). But it is not the same movie and it does not pander and just rehashes what the first one was. This is more of an action adventure with zombies. And some pathos and (melo)drama thrown in for good (or bad) measure.Not everything is great here of course and if you'd ask me which of the two movies I liked better, I'd go with the first one. Still and even though this has its flaws, it is more than entertaining. If you let yourself enjoy it and don't compare it too much or let some drama ruin it. Especially the ending may really make some people at least annoyed. Predictable as it is, it looks and sounds good and is the zombie ride anyone who doesn't mind some explicit gun violence on their screens."
"Surprisingly good even for the overcooked zombie genre. Zombies were numerous; nicely cosmetically zombized with well chosen stunt zombies for expressions & contortions. Additional fight scenes between boring humans added spice to zombie meal. Car chase & zombie mowing added a nice flavorful topping to this movie meal. A few plot twists to keep us guessing. All with some, perhaps humorously, unlikely characterizations. CGI not the best, but good enough unless you're a picky eater."
"I agree with those who feel cheated because this film lacks the effort to show us the personalities of those who made movies in the golden days. Mankiewicz is so random and so troubled that I couldn't get a real direction. From word one I had trouble feeling any sympathy for this man. Gary Oldman is startlingly good, but the direction and writing put him on the stage alone. I would love to have gotten to know a bit more about the other characters from Thalberg to Hearst. I really looked forward to seeing this and sadly will not watch it agaain."
"Hollywood likes to portray Hollywood, like the narcissistic city that it is, and so from time to time you get these high budget, grand cast extravaganzas that do nothing but explain their place of origin. Mank is a black and white ode to the 30's Hollywood era, all wrapped around a conspiracy theory core. You get Gary Oldman playing the cowriter of Citizen Kane, the most important and beloved film that no one really watches anymore, and the story of how the story of this film was written. It wrongly assumes that you not only have watched Citizen Kane, but you are also familiarized with its history, the importance of the little details and the big personalities of the era. And therein lies its failure to connect to the audience.If you ignore that and you don't give a damn about Citizen Kane, you can enjoy a fast talked snapshot of an era film, very well acted and complete with references to events and political strategies that mirror the present. You need to watch it even if only to see that fake news is not something new to 2020. It may be a little too presumptuous, a little self absorbed, but a good film nonetheless. I am sure it's better if you know what the hell it is referring to, though."
"The Call was a fine Korean thriller that had some very good concept and idea but i felt also like that idea could be explored and used in a little better ways then it was.Characters were little uninteresting to and i wasnt able to connect with them but they had some fine conversations over phone in beginning when they were more friendly and towards middle when staff started to change a bit and film turned into a horror.Story was like i said very unique and cool and im not sure if we ever seen something similiar on paper ,but execution was to messy to make it work"
"You have to see this, the flick on flix, wow, what the hell was all that people were talking about. And by know I promised myself never to watch a trailer and go blind into a flick. As I did with this one.The only thing I heard that you needed to se eit for the effects used. And I agree, the effects used here and there are indeed way above mediocre but effects doesn't make a movie as we see here. The story I can dig but why o why does flicks have to clock in over 90 minutes nowadays.By now you do know I wans't into The Call. A lot of blah blah over the, sigh, phone and nothing really happening. Sure, there is blood here and there and some awkward situations with some devilsih doing but overall it was a let down for me. Hyped again by Netflix and by a lot of people on all social media, do not count me in.

"As with most 'time-travel' movies, 'Call (2020)' asks you to take quite a few leaps of logic as it progresses towards its increasingly complex finale. However, if you accept the fact that its two timelines are, essentially, occurring concurrently, most of its narrative (sans one or two mostly harmless inconsistencies) makes perfect sense - or, at the very least, its issues are so small that they can safely be hand-waved away with no detrimental effect. The picture's most, I suppose, iffy moments come during a final, mid-credits interlude that seeks (successfully, I'll add) to insert one last sting into the thing's tail. Although this segment arguably isn't necessary and runs the risk of souring one's final impression, it does what it sets out to - for better or worse - without ruining anything it proceeds. That's all I'll say about the plot, let alone the ending, as I don't want to spoil any aspects of the generally unpredictable affair. It's fantastically subversive, side-stepping expectation in natural and genuinely interesting ways. As a result, it often has you on the edge of your seat. It's a brilliant thriller that builds upon its initial premise almost perfectly. It does eventually threaten to cross the line of credibility and become too much for its own good. It never does, though, and remains a thoroughly engaging, almost captivating experience throughout. It really is great. 8/10"
"""Honest Thief"" is built around the conceit that bank robber Tom Dolan has found the perfect woman that leads him to renounce the world of crime and turn in the $9 million that he stole as the notorious ""In and Out Bandit.""The woman is Annie Wilkins whom Tom meets while renting a couple of units to hide his loot at a self-storage site. The best scene in the film was the first encounter of Tom and Annie. The banter was lively and the chemistry apparent. That scene really jump-started the film.Tom's noble plan to make a deal with the feds goes awry when a couple of corrupt FBI agents attempt to steal the money, kill their supervisor, and blame the crime on Tom. Yet, like Don Quixote, the intrepid bank robber continues in his quest to make amends and cut a deal.The film was crisply directed with a lively pace and excellent location filming. The love theme was carefully balanced with the action sequences, and the result was a combination of heist film, thriller, and romance. Liam Neeson was outstanding in the role of Tom Dolan. Best supporting actor goes to Tazie the dog.While there may not be anything innovative about the film, the bottom line was that this was an entertaining synthesis of tropes from other action pictures with a standout central character of a thief with a heart."
"Honest Thief was somewhat better film from the rest of recent Liam Neeson films but it still had that same vibe through its runtime and it also had predictable plot and only fine action.Honestly i dont know why this guy makes this kind of films,he proved in Schindlers list that he has a great range as a actor and he proved that he can play a dramatic roles very easily,so why in the hell he continues to pick weak and predictable action and thriller films that feel all the same and that offered nothing new its genre or something revolutionary to Liams carrere,Honest Thief was a little better film then recent his his but still it is one them same"
"The headline says it all. It's a mediocre premise with mediocre execution and a bunch of stupid parts and things that make no sense. At least it was fun to see a movie with kyle reese, T-1000, michael weston and zeus. And i'm happy that jeffrey donavan is getting movies roles. I've been saying he should ever since he showed off his wide acting range in burn notice (1 viewing, 6/2/2021)"
"Liam Neeson is the ""In and out bandit"", robbing banks for years. He hasn't been caught, but when he meets the right lady, he decides it's time to give himself up; he tries to return the cash, but it doesn't go as planned. Co-stars Kate Walsh (probably best known as Doctor Montgomery on Grey's Anatomy) as Annie. Can he outwit the dirty FBI agents? He finally comes clean with Annie, but can he work things out before the FBI takes him out? It's fun. One of the two films directed by Mark Williams. Story by Steve Allrich and Mark Williams."
"The film opens hinting at gremlins as Maude Garrett (Chloë Grace Moretz) forges her way on board an airplane at Aukland Air Base, NZ in 1943. She has a package that is classified and can not be opened and must remain up right. She ends up riding in the lower turret where it is cold and has a gremlin. For the first 52 minutes the film consists of Chloë Grace Moretz talking to the vulgar crew on the radio. This was the good part. Then the film becomes over the top (without William Shatner) as if Asylum was making the film using a lot of very bad green screen. They completely ruined the film. Holding on with one finger?Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
3 out of 5 stars.Shadow in the Cloud is a fair action horror film about Chloe Grace Moretz character hitching a ride on a plane with a few soldiers. Needing to deliver a secret package in her luggage. While in the air they face against some gremlin like creature that is destroying the plane and fighting against other enemies that is attacking them in the air.Mix mash plot with a few cat and mouse fight with WWII air battles. Some horror thrills with a creature destroying there plane. While Chloe is locked in a gun cockpit.The script is cheesy with annoying irritating characters. And the dialogue is boring which makes you lose interest in whats going on.Chloe Grace Moretz is awesome in the role. Taking on an action role. The action is pretty decent and entertaining. It can be cheesy. The visual effects are cheesy too.
"This was so many types of genres that ive lost count, and from radiotheatrical to actional to reactional in a 3 step kind of build up + the gremlins of course.so now we all know what can turn a woman into a devil... its easy, just threaten her baby and youll be barely clinging on to life if youre løcky.but most of all a surprising twisted waraction movie of a waiting game the first half, with lots of mediocre radio chattering female dividending gossip at the fence, the second half is just completely supernatjural at all levels.its a small cast, but its just cloe that gives some effort in this film, nothing extravagant, more as expected from that little lioness.production is fair and square, but total lack of story and -line. its a film that the grumpy old man barely recommends with a weak 6"
"3 astronauts arrive at a space station to find a badly injured, unconscious 'stowaway' on board. The implications of having this additional person on board soon become clear.Whilst there are some really quite exciting parts in this film and a convincing / fascinating take off and docking, this is not your average space thriller. Instead it is a relatively gently insight into how professional people cope in extraordinary circumstances, leading to a pleasant albeit not wholly unpredictable ending. Not at all bad with a solid enough cast, it remains watchable if unremarkable."
"Undermined by leaving some big questions unanswered and a frustratingly abrupt ending, Stowaway is still a really good sci-fi drama that's emotional, engaging and tense. Anna Kendrick, Toni Collette, Daniel Dae Kim and Shamier Anderson are all incredible with excellent chemistry. Joe Penna's direction is fantastic, it's beautifully filmed and extremely well paced. The visual effects are impressive and the music by Volker Bertelmann is great."
"So, a stowaway on a mission to Mars. Not only is the idea stupid, it's impossible to happen. This is as bad as the Netflix original with Hilary Swank, where the crew barely gets along on another long space mission. The writers of this pap obviously have no idea how hard Astronauts train and that getting along is part of that training. Just a terrible idea, horribly done. Take my advice, read 'The Cold Equations"" instead. A way better story but, avoid that adaptation as well where they try to give a morality story a happy ending."
"This film start with a man ""Palmer"" riding a bus, and he back to his grandmother house scene! As turnout, this film is about an ex-convict ""Palmer"" need to adopt a boy ""Sam"" from his drug addict mom ""Shelly""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the playing with doll scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the brushing teeth scene, and overuse of the watching TV scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Palmer beating up Daryl! At the end, Palmer adopted Sam! Sam receive a certificate from ""Penelope's Flying Princess Club""! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
"It was really nice movie. I can't say that this film is masterclass or masterpiece but it's standing above average,ordinary movies. Plot was interesting to watch and easy to fallow. Acting was on point,high quality. I would like it to be a little bit deeper and maybe had more harsh moments but it didn't disappoint me. The best film of 2021 so far."
"Load of fake accounts with reviews promoting this movie. Now with smarter fakes.This movie is really slow. It's mis-titled for starters. It should be called Sam, or Palmer and Sam, or The Crying Contest. Seriously, almost every character cries and wants the title.Overall this is a predictable story, troubled child and on and on, not much happens really, and the ending, well, just sort of ends. I guess that's what they call a movie these days.I like JT, but he's downright cringey in this in his multiple attempts to force himself to cry. 3 stars for his performance, not much else is good or worth watching. It's not realistic, multiple inconsistencies, and the fact that JT wants to take care of a kid he only knew for a few days, on a $60/day job, with no savings, and no where to live. Well, that's just rubbish."
"Timberland is position as a comedian for the past 10 years in movie world. This performance changed himself to a real actor. Having said this kind of theme of an grown up with special past along with a special kids be filmed many times, but the focus more on the acting and how story been told. Patience required for this kind of movie."
"It's truly unfortunate the marketing campaign for this film couldn't have been stronger because this is a far cry from the childish films (and some of them work quite well) that illumination puts out on a year-year basis. Onward presents story beats that rival some of Pixar's best over the years with a touching final 15 minutes that catapulted this film up the ranks on this studio's finest work. And most of all, I think the film's ultimate message is one of utmost importance and something we can all learn from. Sometimes the very thing you've been looking for has been right there in front of you the entire time.8.8/10"
"And as you would expect from Pixar, the quality of everything is really good! Be it characters, development, story, jokes, ""drawings""/animation and much more. It really hits home (no pun intended) and always is able to touch your heart. While we are now housebound more or less and for the foreseeable future, this was nice to see in a cinema while I could.There are some cliches and some things that are predictable, but the movie builds a world that makes sense in itself and works within the rules it sets for itself. So yes suspension of disbelief, but a coherent one, where you can be sure that no rules it sets up are being broken (at least not in an overtly obvious way)."
"A fun and wholesome adventure to discover that sometimes what you always needed was with you all along. The story is a unique take on mythical creatures and magic, pitting ancient sorcery and new age technology. The characters are well developed and the storyline had good flow. Lots of fun and heartfelt moments. Lovely!"
"Once upon a time, the world was filled with magic but scientific conveniences eventually replaced magic. In the modern world, elf Ian Lightfoot (Tom Holland) lacks confidence, turning 16, and pines for his dead father whom he never met. His brash older brother Barley (Chris Pratt) is obsessed with the old forgotten magic. One day, their mother (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) finds an old magic staff of their father. Ian uses it to bring back his father but he's only half successful.This could be counted as a failure when compared to the standard exceptional Pixar levels. It just doesn't have that usual Pixar MAGIC. Firstly, the movie should not have started with a magical world introduction. We want to discover it along with the characters, not wait for them to catch up with us. Secondly, the emotional button needs to get hit a lot harder. Up devastated the audience in the first five minutes. This movie needs that so the ending can punch even harder. Quite frankly, the material is in the movie already. It doesn't quite have the power. Thirdly, the half father is weird visually. Without the top, it feels everybody is looking at his crotch. There has to be a better way. Weekend at Bernie's would be a better idea. This is a step down from my Pixar expectations."
"Dame Kristin Scott Thomas follows in the footsteps of Dame Judith Anderson and Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers.Unfortunately Armie Hammer has to follow Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Brett and Charles Dance. Well let's say that unlike Dance who was too old for the role. Hammer is about the age that Oliver was when he played Maxim de Winter.The story is about a lowly young woman (Lily James) who has a whirlwind romance in the south of France with wealthy widower widower Maxim de Winter.When the newly married Mrs de Winter arrives to his ancestral home Manderley. She finds that her naivety is exposed by Mrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper who was hopelessly devoted to Rebecca, the first Mrs de Winter who died in a tragic boating accident about a year before.It is a beginning of mind games between the two characters while Maxim seems to be haunted himself by Rebecca.Director Ben Wheatley has form with low budget English folk horror films. He also directed Peter Capaldi's feature length debut story of Doctor Who.With the help of a Netflix budget. Wheatley focuses more on the courtship in the South of France. There is a folk song played as the couple travel to Manderley which I thought will lead to an eerie Gothic atmosphere.There is a more lesbian subtext regarding Mrs Danvers and her infatuation with Rebecca.Somehow this is rather old fashioned. It is better than the 1997 ITV mini series but I expected more of Wheatley's own stamp."
"This film start with the narrator talking about the manor ""Manderley"", and her employer ""Van Hopper"" scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of the death of Rebecca! Rebecca actually kill by her husband ""Maxim"", but eventually overturn by suicide! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the annoying song playing at the background scene, overuse of the dreaming scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse the passing note scene, and overuse of the dining scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Manderley been burned by Mrs. Danvers at the end! At the end, Maxim release from the jail after proving Rebecca kill herself by Mrs. de Winter! Maxim and Mrs. de Winter move to Cairo at the very end! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
"""Fantasy Island"" is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch five people arriving at a luxurious island where everything is possible. The owner and operator of the fantasy island states that every person has only one fantasy that can be made true so, each person decides its dream or fantasy and starts living it.I did not like the movie because it was boring and full of unnecessary plot twists which were predictable and made the movie even more boring. At first the theme was interesting but after half an hour everything change and became boring and predictable due to poorly execution. The direction which was made by Jeff Wadlow was not the best but I believe he did everything he could in order for it to become better, although nothing changed. Finally, I have to say that ""Fantasy Island"" is not a good movie for all the reasons I stated above and I believe that even if you do not have high expectations from it you will be disappointed and you will think that you wasted your time watching it."
"Not the worst what I've seen this year but it's pretty bad. Too many plot jumps, there are no logic in some episodes. Fantasy Island more like Disaster movie. 4/10 wouldn't recommend to watch it."

"5 people arrive by seaplane to pursue 4 fantasies on Fantasy Island, under the watchful eye of Mr Roarke. The fantasies all seem relatively straightforward - one wants to be a hero soldier like his late father, one wants to correct the worst mistake she ever made, two brothers just want to have a hedonistic millionaires fun weekend, and one wants revenge on a school bully. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the opening sequence where a terrified woman is chased and caught is a clue, as is the fact that the UK Censor's card reveals that the film's full title is Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, Blumhouse being a horror production house.So,the old TV series reimagined as a horror. It's not a bad idea, and the 4 tales here (and the wider story they become part of) are nicely contrived and ravelled together.The cast is decent, with Michael Pena doing well as Mr Roarke. The production values all show on screen, and the film resolves well, with a very welcome kicker at the very end.This was pretty good."
"#ALIVE is a South Korean film with a very simplistic and familiar presence - a young man hides out in his apartment during a zombie apocalypse - that some have linked to the French indie THE NIGHT EATS THE WORLD. But then it is a very generic kind of premise that I had the idea of writing myself a decade or so ago. In any case, films like this live or die depending on the execution, and the good news is that #ALIVE is a winner thanks to plenty of hard work on the part of the director, who wrings maximum suspense, humour and action from that premise. It's fast-paced and engaging, saddled with an annoying but realistic lead who grows on you as the story progresses, and a great female supporting character. The zombies are the scary ones you'll remember from TRAIN TO BUSAN and KINGDOM, making this all the more gripping."
"When it comes down to it, in the end we are alone, even while Alive (which is the actual english title of the movie). Even if there are others around you (zombies or otherwise), you can only count on yourself. Well unless ... although can you even trust yourself? And maybe you can trust others? Maybe not though ... this movie is more on the tension side than on the action side of it.You will still see blood and violence, just don't expect this to be something it isn't. Having said that, this may very well be an accurate version of what would happen in a very densely populated area ... and how some people would react to it. Not just our main character. If that sounds good to you, give it a shot (no pun intended, especially because there aren't that many weapons to begin with) ..."
"Zombies are supposed to be the living dead, but zombies have been so abused and misused that the fad is gone. Zombies are dead so stop beating them.This Korean zombie movie is no different than any other movie ever produced. It is a guy locked up in his apartment playing online games to find out through the news that a dust cloud has come in to the city and is causing people to turn in to zombies.So if it is a dust cloud, why are so few people getting infected when they are running through the streets? you would expect 99% of the population to become infected instantly. And why do people think that humans are some sort of awesome predator with out weapons? We don't have claws, we don't have sharp teeth. Have you ever tried to eat a raw steak? It's nearly impossible unless you cut it up in to very tiny pieces to make it easier to chew.Zombies are worthless and these movies are boring. Please stop making them."
"'#Alive' finds drama and tension within one man's apocalyptic imprisonment while zombies are largely kept locked outside, only posing a threat while society crumbles and we become our worst enemies."
"This film exceeded my expectations tbh. It was suspenseful, thrilling amd never really ends up boring because of the fast pace. Absolutely smart with the technology-style but could've use more of that."
Kevin Heart never dissapoints so far - even though this movie is not that typical comedy which Kevin is. But few joke lines saved it - so if you watch it with couple it will be a good one James Welch Henderson Arkansas 6/18/21.
"Fatherhood is a 2021 Netflix/Columbia Pictures Comedy Drama starring Kevin Hart,Melody Hurd,Deborah Ayorinde and Alfre Woodard. Directed by Chris Weiz(who was
the writer for About A Boy) and based on a novel by Matthew Logelin titled Two Kisses For Maddy: A Memoir Of Loss and Love. The story is about Matthew Logelin(Hart) an African American who's been with his wife Liz(Deborah Ayorinde) since they were kids. However when Matt's wife is pregnant and has to go under a C Section for her baby,tragedy strikes when Liz dies leaving Matt heartbroken as he is left to rear his daughter Maddy(Melody Hurd) on his own without a mother figure for his child. While struggling with Maddy,Matt later meets a woman named Swan(DeWanda) and he strikes a relationship with her. But is he moving too quick or will he learn the challenges of being a single parent as well as facing obstacles along the way?Alot of people may be baffled as to why they cast an African American for Matt Logelin instead of a Causcian but I didn't pass any remarks on the casting for this film.Kevin Hart was very good in this film(he also served as a producer too with Chris Weiz), as I am so used to seeing him as the wise cracking buddy of Dwanye Johnson and being typecast in alot of his films.I've always loved Kevin Hart so that's why I watched it. If your a fan of Kevin Harts do check it out on Netflix.B."
"Loved Kevin Hart in this, he played the role perfectly, using some comedy but sticking mostly to the drama and being serious. The storyline flowed well but the ""all falls apart"" felt forced and wasn't necessary."
"Loved Kevin Hart in this, he played the role perfectly, using some comedy but sticking mostly to the drama and being serious. The storyline flowed well but the ""all falls apart"" felt forced and wasn't necessary."
"This movie stars a very fine actor who looks remarkably like the comedian Kevin Hart. In fact, he looks so much like Hart that the producers have tried to pass him off as Hart - no doubt to capitalize on Hart's popularity. I don't think this actor has to worry about being sued by Hart for impersonation or anything like that, however. This actor is so good, gives such a powerful and often deeply moving performance, that Hart must be hoping that viewers believe it is actually Hart.I myself spent much of this movie wondering if the person I saw on screen could possibly actually be Kevin Hart. Is that possible????The actor, whoever he may be in real life, gets strong support from Alfre Woodard as the mother-in-law who cannot forgive him, a child actress who does not play cute, and a script that, more often than not, avoids the obvious and the cheap laugh, delivering instead a punch right in the emotional gut. This movie is not always easy to watch. But it is impossible to stop watching.If you don't like Kevin Hart's previous movies - and I didn't care for some of them - watch this. You will be amazed. If you did like his previous movies, watch it as well. You will also be amazed. It's an amazing movie."
"Yet another spin on superheros, 'Project Power (2020)' posits a world in which a new drug allows users to unleash their inner power - whatever it may be - for five minutes a pop. It's an interesting premise that, essentially, takes a traditional action-thriller and sprinkles some of the oh-so-popular superhero genre on top. It may sound cynical, but it doesn't feel it. It's generally an enjoyable time, despite its uneven tone and somewhat vague plot. It also has a few stand-out set-pieces which are approached in rather unique ways, such a hectic fight sequence that's only seen from inside a giant tank. The leads all do a good job with the material - though, Gordon-Levitt seems to think he's in a comedy - and the pacing is always tight enough to maintain engagement. It isn't going to get you thinking - in fact, you'll probably notice some plot problems if you do - but it should keep you entertained. 7/10"
"""Project Power"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an ex-soldier, a police officer and a teenage dealer trying to stop a group of people from delivering a pill that gives to users unpredictable powers. They have to cooperate and trust each other if they want to succeed.I found this movie interesting but not something amazing or new since there are plenty Sci-Fi movies which have to do with superpowers and a way of gaining those. The interpretations of both Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played as Frank and Jamie Foxx who played as Art were good and the combination of them worked very well. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Dominique Fishback who played as Robin. All in all, I have to say that ""Project Power"" is a nice movie to spend your time with but if you are about to watch it, I advise you to lower your standards otherwise you will be disappointed by it."
"On sugar pills entertainment, but its a flippy floppy quality technical production, with lots of incoherence and a more bold than perfect on the plain things that makes a film a ''good'' film. there are big flaws in the sound production, and the use of score with a volume button turning up and down each time there are dialouges are cheap and unescesarry. the sound management has forgotten how much noise a moving ship makes. and the calmity of the calamity make the silence airpinning irritating. also the editing has its issues, and the plot dives headless back and forth.the acting are following the directors commands and very scriptous, not much freestyling here. the extras panicking do have a low standardto the positive, lots of great special effects and the fruitful light and coloration are faboulous but thats merely it, and its of course positive that the grumpy old man hung on to the end, but its a neat beacon in a rather dark pandemic season so enjoy, its recommendable entertainment."
"One of the turn offs for this production is the pill. Watching some one have to not only swallow the pill, but turn it? then it makes a sound? And it looks like there is a tiny galaxy inside it? Talk about ruining the mood. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.There is nothing wrong with the acting, the casting is good, the cinematography too. The special effects are hit or miss, some are awesome, some are terrible. The script is off as well the directing.The idea of stealing some essence from a person and then using it to make ""juice"" to give temporary super powers is nothing new. Bad Boys for example, on Amazon already has this but it isn't in pill form. There are other stories with the same premise. So no kudos on originality.Other than this, it was worth a one time watch. However, this isn't going to win any awards. There is nothing special about this movie."
"The cinematography throughout this movie was quite beautiful, with the landscapes and the cgi on the animals. The characters were well acted and well scripted, but they had no depth. I didn't find myself very emotionally invested in the story. It was a decent movie in all aspects, it just wasn't too much of anything which left it a bit underwhelming."
More CGI than I was expecting but the CGI was really good. Not too surprising as they are doing man's best friend and they have it down packed. A new entry in this era of dogpilation has mega star Harrison Ford taking a back seat to a dog drawn on a computer and it's a warm tale that will definitely get dog lovers to cry.
"There have been several movies ""Call of the Wild"" but this is the first time one has told the entire story in Jack London's book. The real main character is the big dog, Buck, and his transformation from house pet to sled dog to alpha male of his own hybrid Timberwolf pack.This movie in its form could not have been made with real dogs. Instead they used state of the art motion capture to generate realistic animation for the animals. This is covered quite nicely in a series of ""making of"" extras on the movie disc.Harrison Ford, almost 80 now, is very effective as the narrator and the old prospector that befriends Buck. This is a really good movie, at first the sight of an animated Buck threw me off but soon it made no difference, the story is so good.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie."
"This is a sanitized adaptation of Jack London's novel. It leaves out some killings. Buck, the wonder dog, is dog-napped and sent to Alaska where he excels and passes from one owner to another although no one ever really owns Buck. The film includes some minor narration. Geared for a young male audience, although anyone can enjoy it. Realistic CG.Jack London was an atheist and a socialist in case you were unaware."
"This film start with the narrator talking about Branch and Poppy saving the trolls world in the previous film, and the introduction of a evil queen ""Queen Barb"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Poppy and Branch need to unite all the music trolls by defeat Queen Barb! Entire film full of music instrument flashing scene, and laughable scene! Make the film quite watchable! All the song sing in the film also quite connect to the scene! Make the film quite imaginable to watch! Laughable scene! Such as, Guy Diamond saying he is pregnant, Tiny Diamond pop out from his body right away! Branch and Poppy catching a fly look alike monster from Mr. Biggie! Father of Poppy eating the flyer reading by Poppy! Poppy throwing a stick from Branch's weapon box, the stick stuck at Mr. Dinkles nose! Mr. Biggie, Mr. Dinkles, Poppy and Branch singing at the Country Music Trolls kingdom! Hickory saving Branch, Poppy, Mr. Biggie, and Mr. Dinkles out of the jail! Poppy dreaming she eating Sushi! Tresillo challenge the K-Pop gang a dance-off! At the end, Poppy defeat Queen Barb by breaking her ultimate chord's curse! All the music trolls unite at last! Still have a post credit scene! The Grizzly troll whining about he missing the trolls music party! That's it! A must watch animation film!"
"Trolls World Tour (2020) is a movie I watched with my daughter as soon as it came out. The storyline involves a larger Trolls universe where you see how other trolls live. One group of trolls, into heavy metal, feel all trolls should live like them and sets out to make that happen. Can our friends from the previous trolls picture stop the invading trolls? This movie is codirected by Walt Dohrn (Trolls) and David P. Smith (The Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed) and contains the voices of Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Justin Timberlake (The Social Network), Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2) and George Clinton (Good Burger). The storyline for this is good enough to keep your attention but not great overall. I did like the use of music but felt the movie had a strange way of cutting the songs I liked short and making the long music scenes just okay. There is a good lesson or two in here and it does have some worthwhile coming of age elements. This is an above average addition to the genre that is worth a viewing but not adding to your DVD collection. I'd score this a solid 7/10."
"""I hate to say this but i can say that this one is a little bit better than the first one, i don't know why but maybe because this is kinda my thing you know, Rock music, Classic music, Pop music, so i really really enjoyed this, and the weird thing is i got goosebumps like 4 or 5 time, it's crazy, i am not expecting that, and of course i really want to hate this sequel because the first one is just a great, beautiful, and fun movie but i can't, this is a really good and cool movie, and you know one of the coolest thing in here? Ozzy freakin Osbourne, yes even though he have a little part and dialogue he's still very cool here, Trolls World Tour is not a movie or a sequel that everybody can like but it can be great and likeable especially for those who love this kinda thing, highly recommended"""
"Since i havent seen the first trolls film i went with this one completly blind i was only hoping that this film will have some cute moments or catchy songs,so did it have it,well i must admit that it did,songs even very famous in our world in film sound different but without disrespect or some hidden messages that arent for this kind of film,i can also say that designs of trolls are very unique an their hairstyles are very colourful and it did give movie a nice dose of said colour and life that breathes fast and engaging,trolls world tour isnt great or very good film it is watchable enterteinmant but it lacks supstance in storytelling to be something more"
"The Trolls are back ... in village/town. And if you got a song reference there, you might be the right recipient and the right one to watch the sequel here. It has been a while since I saw the first Trolls movie, but I would say these work independently. That being said, I did rememeber the character and who spoke them.But as with every good sequel (or I reckon every sequel for that matter), you get a lot of new character thrown in the mix here. The movie had the bad luck (as many others) of having to be released in a year that we got hit with a pandemic - hello future readers! So it might have been quite more succesful and more on the radar of many more people.The story is quite simple and predictable. It is the songs and the voice cast that really carry the movie along. It is more than fun ... just go with the flow ... or even sing a long! More colors than you can bear probably."
"Unlike so many of the shallow and unoriginal products we're bombarded with through the usual channels and distributors, this outstanding piece of sci-fi cinema brushes them aside with an imaginative story, great special effects, likeable characters and, above all, an engaging story whose message is as valid today as it is in the future earth where the story unfolds."
The dialogue and story are fairly simple and straight forward. Acting is lame. Lots of teens acting and it's a teens only movie. Nothing interesting.
"I enjoyed this film. However I might have struggled to follow the storyline without the subtitles as it is multi- lingual from Korean, English, French, fillipino, Chinese & Russian. This would be to appeal a worldwide audience and also perhaps appease the investors. It is an ambitious feat.The special effects were decent and I loved the interaction & chemistry between the cast. The child actor is so charming and the bunch of misfits ensue there is a slap stick humour. The action scenes were interesting. This is a dystopian film whereupon hope for humanity lies upon a child.It even has a star wars type fighting. The ending is uplifting..."
"As a massive fan of South Korean cinema I was looking forward to this one and tried really hard to like it, but in the end it does come across as very bland. I'm not sure if Netflix trod on the Koreans and forced them to make this accessible to an international audience but it feels extremely generic and lightweight, like a carbon copy of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY or something. I watch Korean stuff to see Korean style and the usual quirkiness, not something that could have been churned out on a production line by Hollywood. Sure, the characters are likeable enough, but the rescue story is extremely basic and doesn't sustain the near two and a half hour running time, so this feels like it goes on forever. The CGI effects are nondescript and the cheesiness becomes all too apparent as it goes on, particularly in the ridiculous ending. Not an awful film, but a disappointment given what Korea's usually capable of."
"Predictability doesn't have to be a sin when it comes to the often paint-by-the-numbers world of romantic comedy, but this awkward combination of expectation and disdain for it make for a film only fleetingly worthy of celebration."
"Everything that we've ever seen in romantic comedies featuring protagonists who hit it off as friends-(with-non-sexual)-benefits and later fall in love (aw!), is packaged in the form of a perfunctory cliche in 'Holidate'. The film is so by-the-numbers that you can keep your eyes closed, randomly name the leads X & Y, and it'd all end up exactly the way you expect. No real surprises in the screenplay (by Tiffany Paulsen) - it's a ragbag of ""I've-seen-that-before""s, oozing cheese and gloss. The leads, Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey, look great but they play stock characters that only appear in dreary, easy-on-the-brain rom-coms. The humor is the biggest letdown here: the only time I even chuckled was when a mother of two explains who a wh*re is, to her kids."
"The chemistry between the two leads is so great. They are very convincing as lovers, which makes it particularly enjoyable to watch."
Sloane (Emma Roberts) hates being stuck at the kids table during another family Christmas. She meets Jackson (Luke Bracey) at a store return line. They both hate being single on the holidays and decide to be each other's Holidate.There are some good rom-com ideas. The meet-cute is good. It's almost a good rom-com. There are issues with the construction. The stakes are never that high since the ending is always inevitable. It's not all one thing and it's not all down to one person. The actors are fine. The filmmaking is functional. The premise has some problems and the writing is just a little bit off.
"The new Netflix Romantic comedy started so awfully (first 5 mins) that I wanted to turn it off, but for some reason I persevered and I'm happy I did. The piot is fairly original, the two lead actors work well together, it made me laugh and in general it had a good feel to it. A thumbs up from me."
"Or should i say slainthe, that will sooth the action seekers. its got a vary cliched story, and some very staged and practiced fist fights and shootouts, but it has also got some glorious good twists in some of the fights and battles between the crooked crooks of bad criminals, bad coppers and convicted coppers. this made me actually laugh several times so the entertainment factor is really there.production wise its not a marvel, its a fast shifting ,block jumping charade of theme shifts and camera angles, loads of barking men and also women in nonsense dialouges, some of the lightsetting management and thereoff some of the camerawork are quite amateurish, it wont reack the top of a ten story building, because the elevator doesnt go farther than the 8th floor. the 9 and 10th are for the proffesionals that use their hands feet and head to make the difference in the cinematic world.but by all means its a peerworthy and honest thinks the grumpy old man, the acting are overall good with the stars well replaced by stunters at the most spectacular takes and moves. mr wahlberg is a lucky guy with his pretty common looks and appearances, so there are plenty people to take from to do his moves and cam from behind the back shots.its a recommend and a sequel will come...."
"I don't really know what gives a movie a cinematic feel. But i'm so sick of the straight-to-dvd feel that so many of these movies have. This seems to be the case with anything made by netflix. Just because a movie doesn't go to theaters, does that mean it's not allowed to feel cinematic? Maybe there's a rule i'm not aware of.This movie is below average in basically every area. Writing, story, comedy and general entertainment are all lacking. It's not horrible, but not worth my time (1 viewing, 4/13/2021)"

"An amateur and seasoned writer came up with a nonsense convoluted mess of a screenplay with plot and technical issues galore. I think this film lost it's way trying to be a mismash of a parody-action-comedy-mystery-thriller that manages to spectacularly fail at all the above. Had it chosen one or two points of genre, it could've so been much better. Even the action was lackluster. The best part of this film was the soundtrack. Great to see an all star cast having fun though."
"It is the year 2049 and a disaster has devastated the Earth. An isolated observatory in the Arctic Circle is staffed by one, terminally-ill, scientist. He is determined to contact any off-planet travellers from Earth to warn them of the disaster and see if they can help. Little does he know but he has company.Directed by and starring George Clooney, this film had heaps of potential: the intrigue around the disaster, the scientist trying to get help, the crew of the space craft and their adventures. Clooney initially builds an interesting plot with some engaging characters.However, he doesn't know what to do with this solid foundation. Things get drawn out in the middle section - quite a few scenes that were unnecessary and just padding.There's still a chance that the film will go somewhere special but, unfortunately, it doesn't. The ending is quite the damp squib: largely predictable and unprofound.Disappointing."
"OK. What happened. This movie's first half is really engaging. As Augustine and the little girl make their way to transmitting station, it works very well. The bond that develops is sweet and yet terrifying. What happens next plays fast and loose with the first part. I wish we had some idea what happened to the earth. Then there's that space ship heading home and lots of superfluous stuff. Very slow but not really introspective. I'm disappointed in this."
Absolutely incredible cinematography probably the best aspect about it! I guess others are right about the story going nowhere but it was definitely nice to watch spontaneously with my mom which I don't usually well with being an aspie. The cast and epicness that occurs is magnificent! Definitely left me feeling uncertain in parts and slightly bored regardless I love a large portion of it.
"I can't do it any more. Almost every time i watch a netflix movie, it's the same feeling: pointless. I am a self-proclaimed movie fiend. I watch hundreds of movies each year. And yet when it comes to having any kind of intrigue, netflix is completely incompetent. How many times can they make a movie fiend ask himself ""why am i watching this?""as to this specific piece of netflix garbage. It's two parallel stories with some connections, but they're not dependent on one another. The characters might be (not really) but the stories are not. With a couple tweaks, each can be told without the other. So rather than feeling like one big story with two parts, it feels like two different movies. Neither of which are the least bit interesting or entertaining.I can't understate how boring this movie is. I had to force myself to finish it. They did an awful job of making me care. At all. About anything. Or anyone.The only thing of value here is some cool space shots. The end.I forgot to mention how many things it tried to steal from the GOAT movie Interstellar. Key word tried. For anyone who thinks this movie is good, i implore you to watch Interstellar. You will no longer consider midnight sky a movie (1 viewing, 6/18/2021)"
"Jack Cunnigham (Ben Affleck) works construction and loves canned drinks, perhaps too much. He was a basketball player who has been asked to come back to high school and coach. We watch him swear at the kids and drink. He has anger and sorrow over a lost son and now a separated wife seeing a rich guy. The characters were not that great and we wait for the moment he realizes he has an alcohol problem and turns his life around. The event happens with 12 minutes of film left and doesn't do the film justice.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"The way back is a very watchable sport film that deals with sports aspects of a story but it also deals with more problematic issuses for our lead character and it shows how can that easily ruin peoples lifes but it also give us message that we can always recover from it and to continue in a new better way,affleck give perhaps his best performance in life and even if i know that he wont but it would nice that he wins some award for this film since he deserves it,this film follows some cliches that are typical for this genre and it didnt offered nothing new but it also give me good time in front of tv"
"Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) is an alcoholic construction worker separated from his wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) after a devastating tragedy. He is convinced to coach his alma mater Catholic high school Bishop Hayes basketball team. It's the site of his greatest glory where he threw away his potential and started a descent into addiction.As a sports underdog story, this is very standard and straight forward. The most non-standard aspect of that happens at the end when it stops short. It's also very stripped down. The kids would normally get more screen time. Only one kid gets a functional character progression. Mostly, this is compelling for Ben Affleck playing a struggling alcoholic and director Gavin O'Connor trying to strip him down to the studs. My only complaint about his part is that he needs to show his self-destructiveness more overtly in the beginning. He should start in a bad place and then recover over the movie until he starts backsliding. It doesn't need to be a mystery."
"Story is typical the kind. When I saw the casts, I really expecting more but the point of laugh just so low and lame. Super disappointing."
"Cosmic rays give a few sociopaths superhuman power which is used to disrupt Chicago as if they would notice. Emily (Octavia Spencer ) is a geneticist who develops a method to give normal humans super abilities. Her blue collar friend Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) accidentally gets strength leaving Emily with invisibility.This is a popcorn flick. For those who missed the overweight humor of Melissa McCarthy, it is back. Pom Klementieff who played Mantis in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" plays the villain Laser. Jason Bateman has a silly role with crab hands. I enjoyed the low brow humor of it all and the 80's music.Guide: No F-words, sex or nudity."
"I agree not the best comedy action movie out there but guardians of the galaxy and bad boys are extremely rare movies !! This had a few laughs, some decent special effects and a ok story. Like I said it was decent in no means a 1. People give those piece of crap garbage found FOOTAGE films ( glorified home movies) better rating than this and found FOOTAGE movies are complete and utter garbage!! Watch this with the understanding that's it just a 5 and you'll enjoy it."
"If your looking for a movie that does not tug at your heart, and just has fun with itself, then Thunder Force is that movie for you. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer have such awesome chemistry, and you can clearly see they are having fun making this.In a world populated by supervillains known has Miscreants, twohildhood friends(Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer) developed there own superpowers and become the superhero team known has Thunder Force, in hopes to take them down.An amusing superhero comedy, never tries to be anything more then just a fun film. The rest of the cast do well also, really letting there comic appeal shine through, like Jason Bateman and Bobby Cannavale."
"It's all highly cinematic (and exaggerated to an extent) and it's clichés galore in the characterization department, yet Happiest Season is a film that leaves you emotionally fulfilled. It follows the formula but adds ample doses of heart, making everything magically work. In this film, you'll witness brilliant performances from Kristen Stewart and Dan Levy. Their friendship (more than the film's core lesbian love story) is what stands out as a truly memorable story arc. The thing about the Caldwell household is that nearly everyone's got something to hide, and that makes it a little easier for writer-director Clea DuVall to collectively provide closure to their issues.Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart share decent chemistry as a queer couple. But I've gotta say those few scenes that featured Aubrey Plaza and Stewart make you feel like they had some totally untapped chemistry. That's for another film to tackle, I guess. Happiest Season is tonally all over the place, oscillating between wacky comedy and genuinely emotional moments. And as a Christmas flick, Happiest Season isn't technically the 'happiest' though it manages to get there eventually (after a lot of misery!). It's an enjoyable 100-minutes alright!"
"Happy couple Stewart and Davis go to Davis' parents for Christmas which is full of tradition, snobbery, family disagreements, old lovers and the father trying to get the nomination for Mayor. The real issue though is that Davis tells Stewart before they arrive that she hasn't told her parents she's gay, so Stewart reluctantly has to pretend to be her hetrosexual flat mate.As a drama about being yourself and understanding everyone's trial of life it works quite well. It is though supposed to be a comedy as well with Stewart and catty mum, Steenburgen both on good form. The comedy though switches off half way through and it all becomes pure drama, missing a number of opportunities. A well made festive drama with good performances all around, it's just that the balance is rather off kilter."
"Here is a nice little story about a woman going to meet her girlfriend's parents for the first time without knowing if they will approve of the relationship or not. It was mostly entertaining, even though the girlfriend made so many outrageous choices that a real person would probably easily avoid. It kept my interest, but I didn't really feel the emotion between the two leads. It was a lukewarm romance at best. But generating onscreen passion wasn't really the point. It was about whether this woman would be willing to stay with someone who wasn't being true to herself or their feelings for one another. There was some enjoyable comedy and nice performances, but I don't see it becoming a holiday classic."
"I don't usually ship... but I ship Abby and Riley. Otherwise, this film is pretty good. Decent acting, typical storyline, and a great cast. Dan Levy steals the show and Kristen Stewart surprisingly displays a range of emotions. Well done all."
"What worked:
So what makes Mimi a great watch is an almost balanced perspective regarding the dilemma that appears at the last act of the movie. Of course it's an tearjerker at times with the execution but keeping the hopes alive, decoding them, and giving just reasonings for the perspective makes it an alive, scholar and beautiful watch. Rehman keeps the movie much alive with the score and music, an equally great work by the director. It would have felt flat had the performances were less powerful and dull. Kriti gave the best performances so far. Manoj, Pankaj and Supriya excelled very well in their parts making the overall movie a fine watch. I was pleasantly surprised by the screenplay of the movie especially its scope, layers and overall a balanced character portrayal
What did not work:
There were some rooms for improvements of course but all the melodramas and tearjerkers were equally valid. After-all it's a local movie in the local context. The movie could still have been valid even without some scenes with sentimental values to cut down the runtime.Final verdict: highly recommended."
This movie has a great message. And first time I liked kriti's acting. As always pankaj is amazing. And all the actors did an amazing job. And above all music and background score by AR Rahman is Best. A must watch.
"Poor old 'Scoob!'. Meant to be the grand launch of a 'Hanna Barbera Cinematic Universe' released to great fanfare, due to the pandemic it ended up being shunted to VOD, released in cinemas in some countries, in others not, before ending up on DVD, where it probably has found its actual home.This isn't old-school 'Scooby Doo'. The mystery element is sidelined, making way instead for super-heroes (because there hasn't been enough films about them recently...), A list voice actors taking over the roles from the folks who do the straight to DVD films, and a lot of pop culture gags that probably won't endear the film to future generations. ""Daddy, who's Kelly Clarkson?"" etc.It is however an awful lot of fun, I enjoyed it far more than I anticipated, and if you can embrace this new take, then you may well enjoy it too.I hope it does end up launching a shared universe series."
"This was an average adaptation of the Scooby-Doo cartoons and stories, and any fan of the franchise will recognize the story and formula. I sort of liked it but was confused by the updates. I liked the Captain Caveman cameo. The story was ok at best. My recommendation is to stick with the classic cartoons, but you might like this movie.** out of ****"
"It is a family adventure, though a bit silly at times. The pop culture references are fun, especially the line about Chris or Liam. Overall, it is a brain off family film."
"I love Scooby-doo but this film was a boring silly superhero movie, it started off fairly good but then went over the top & so much happens that you can tell it's the starter for a Hannah Barbara Connected Universe as we meet lots of their characters & too much silliness happens & nothing is funny or even memorable at all!!!! Really a wasted opportunity to bring our beloved Mystery Gang back but here we hardly spend any time with them as it focuses more on Mark Whailberg's Blue Falcon superhero who is so bland & boring too!!!!
A really silly childish & very boring kids flick that may entertain very little kids but not long time fans & we get a really weird & really un-funny & un-clever part for Simon Cowell??????? Maybe funny about 12 yrs ago but is embarrassing here & so out of place but all that said it is nice & colourful & harmless fun for little"
"It is the Hanna Barbera cinematic universe. Already familiar with me, as a kid I used to watch the All Star Laff-A-Lympics cartoons.Made in CGI, you have the origins of how Shaggy met Scooby Doo. They even recreate the original title sequence in CGI.If you are eagle eyed you will spot references to Scooby Doo and other Hanna Barbera carton characters such as a poster of Hong Kong Phooey.More prominent is Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, Captain Caveman, the villain is Dick Dastardly and in due course Muttley makes an appearance.Dastardly is after Scooby Doo who is the last descendant of a dog that belonged to a famous warrior. Dastardly plans to use Scooby Doo to unleash the three headed Cerberus.The fun is Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the Mystery Machine gang. It is updated with plenty of pop cultural references.I thought Blue Falcon was the weak link, the plot was a bit naff but my children enjoyed it."
"This wasn't bad but... After 14 years a lot of things have changed and the issue is in the first movie they could make more aggressive,racist,dark humour than they can do now. Film is still nice despite that. They had idea, they stick to it. Another con or issue I see in this movie is giving more attention to women. I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention... In my opinion, they could've waited a little bit longer and create better script for this movie, because first movie was masterpiece and this only Meh which is really disappointing."
"Sacha Baron Cohen doesn't seem to have been in a rush to make a sequel to his hit 2006 movie, but when he got around to it he created a crazed masterpiece. Once again a Kazakhstan filmmaker comes to the United States and a very bizarre culture clash ensued. Once again the fictional story is furthered by people tricked into thinking they are involved in something other than a Cohen film.This time around Borat is joined by his daughter, Tutar, played by Maria Bakalova with the same mad, fearless verve as Cohen. They both start the movie believing that women are useless animals who should be kept in cages, but exposure to America gives Tutar an interesting story arc. Along the way we meet debutantes, conspiracy theorists, and a mix of lovely and awful people (who are sometimes the same people!).The movie is hilarious and utterly insane. Check it out!"
"Borat's back and unless he can get his act together, hopefully for the last time. You would think, given the potential targets, (Trump, Covid), this could be the best Borat film yet and yet a lot of gags fall flat. Yes, i laughed and loudly every now and then but nowhere near as often as I thought I would. Still, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"", to give it its short title, (and that title in itself reeks of desperation), is still worth seeing thanks to a brilliant, star-making turn from Maria Bakalova as Borat's daughter, Tutar.The very thin excuse for a plot has Borat revisiting America with said daughter in tow and a plan to offer her as a gift to VP Mike Pence, (yes, that's about as original as it gets). Needless to say, Pence isn't interested though his appearance does mark one of the film's few inspired moments so the sights are set on Rudy Giuliani who is either even dumber than we thought or a rather good sport for going along with it. The candid-camera style sequences still work but much of this looks rehearsed and the wonderful Miss Bakalova deserves better. Will she deserve the Oscar should she win? Probably not but I can certainly see a long future ahead of her."
"Upfront, I think it's fair to say that I found this whole story rather dull and depressing. Indeed, for much of it I was wondering why on earth anyone would choose to take this story - full of pejorative and downbeat references - and dramatise it at all. The performances themselves, however, are much more fulfilling. Amy Adams is superb as the addict mother whose son is heading down similarly disruptive tram lines before the intervention of his feisty grandmother Glenn Close. Based on a true story, it relates the not insubstantial trials faced by the family as their dysfunctional unit tries to make some headway against seemingly insurmountable odds. Close is so unlike anything I have ever seen her in before: dowdy, strong, angry, flawed - but determined that despite himself (and his mother) her grandson ""J.D."" (played well as a child by Owen Asztalos; less impactfully as an adult by Gabriel Basso) is going to try to make something of himself. The interweaving chronology of the narrative makes this a bit more interesting too, as they all have their demons to face down. Taken in isolation, the story is just a bit so what - but for once the dramatisation and screenplay give the talent plenty to work with and grim as it it, at times, it has engenders some feeling of redemption that helps it be a bit more than the sum of it's parts."
"Just recently I watched a documentary about child abuse. And this fits right into this. Or fits the bill as some would say. Now it makes sense that this is also based on a true story. The actors in this are phenomenal. But I do understand people having issues with this. Starting with the already mentioned abuse. Mental and physical abuse that is. And for some maybe really tough to comprehend how someone would be that way. But there are explanations and even when others (and myself included) may think: don't do it, there seems now way that is helping anyone at all ... that does not take into account what the characters feels that moment. The love for ones mother can be quite big, even when others may think it is undeserved ... another similarity between this and the documentary.This then is not an easy movie to watch at all. This will put you to the test or rather your patience. Try to take this for what it is, flaws and all included. It is not so much about what you yourself would do, but what makes ""sense"" for the characters to do ... Reality is not always rosy - and this movie is about just that. The tough moments, with very few light moments in between. Be aware of that"

". . . (or its singular pronunciation) in her mouth, but that's exactly what many of the Haters seem to be doing with GRETEL & HANSEL. The only proper way to see this flick is AFTER you've stayed up too late the night before (that is, when you're suffering from not getting enough sleep). That way, as GRETEL & HANSEL unspools and you're fighting to stay awake in one of those new, ultra comfortable plush reclining theater chairs, you'll be able to empathize perfectly with the challenges facing title heroine ""Gretel"" throughout this film. Like her, you'll be constantly wondering, ""Did I just see THAT, or was it only a dream?"" Just as a certain type of person used to enjoy those ""John Wayne"" Westerns with ALL punches pulled, what's there NOT to appreciate about a ""horror"" movie in which EVERY bit of foreshadowing and gore might turn out to be figments of someone's dream (either yours, or the film crew's)? So as the old witch is slowly incinerated at the end, pinned to the wall of her killing room, who can say that this scene is any more horrible than a piece of wood burning during one of those Yule Log DVDs?"
"This 2020 horror film stars Sophia Lillis, Sam Leakey and Alice Krige based on the Grimm Fairytale. This dark version of the classic tale tells about teenage girl, Gretel (Lillis) who takes care of her younger brother, Hansel (Leakey). Soon, they stumble onto a mysterious house in the woods where an old woman, Holda (Krige) dwells. She welcomes them and provides plenty of food in exchange for them doing chores, but Gretel discovers that Holda is not whom she seems. This is an eerie flick with a decent cast, some creepy settings and a chilling score. You could give this a view if you're into supernatural horror or scary stories."
"I enjoyed this movie. i liked the tone, i loved the music, and it was visually stunning. well made all around, and very different from normal horror movies (1 viewing, 10/15/2020)"
"It looks good.I haven't read the book, but it's better."
"It looks good.I haven't read the book, but it's better."
"I watched the movie this morning and I put a review with a mixed response. Later, I realised that there are so many beautiful moments in this movie which I just can't forget and I realised that it's a pretty good movie than what I wrote in the first review. So I deleted it and I'm writing again. ATBP is far from perfect but the makers made sure that it's a pretty good YA romance. The performances are top notch and I'm a Elle Fanning fan way before. She gave a powerful and very good portrayal of Violet. Justice Smith also did a good job and he's good in emotional characters. Other than Elle Fanning, the best thing I liked in this movie is the music. The music is so sweet and mind blowing and will be in your mind for a long time and it's an integral part of the moving of the movie. The cinematography is also good and they have captured the places they go well beautifully. The movie starts so well and I liked the first half much better than the second. The setting up was so good upto their first kiss and after that the movie slows a bit. Overall, ATBP is a good, watchable movie. Some people may find it boring because it's slow in some parts but looking back at the final product, I'm more than satisfied."
"Brining awareness to psychological problems, issues and pressure (also from society), while making an at least somewhat interesting if not entirely entertaining movie, is quite a hard task. And I'll admit my inner cynic had some hills to climb, some flaws to swallow, to see and not be on the pessimistic, critic side of this movie.Having said all that and while it felt that Mr Pikachu (he's done other movies since and before that, but bare with me or endulge my joke at least) felt like most comfortable when he was the happy go lucky guy. Not the serious brooding, thoughtful, too much in his own head Dude. Or ""freak"" as some call him. I think that quite a lot of people will be able to relate to him. Not just since the Pandemic, but generally speaking. Elle Fanning might also be best, when she can show her joyful side, but she can be sad and introvert too.This really is a warning, a social message packed into a movie. Do not take anyone for granted. Talk to each other, enjoy life if you can. Try to stay positive, but even more importantly spread that message and even if you can't tell by looking at a person who's close to you, tell them what they mean to you. Try to make the world a brighter place, so all the bright places would add up to a great/high number"
"Don't get me wrong. the book was good. This just added more visual and emotion in my opinion as they were all well casted with actors that made the emotions come to life.To those who believe that in the movie we didn't find out about Fitch's mental instability until late, you clearly were not watching the signs right form the begining.7.3"
"After Cassius Clay (Eli Goree ) defeats Sonny Liston (Aaron D. Alexander ) he has an after party with Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge ), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr., and no women. Malcolm X is a real party-poop and puts a dampener on everything wanting to talk about how evil white people are, while looking over his shoulder. All of the characters weigh in on the race issue. Cooke and Brown agree it is economic empowerment. Malcolm X draws a hard solid line. You are either for or against. And Ali is all about Ali.The fictional conversations were interesting and most likely more meaningful than the ones they really had that night. Well done.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"Obviously a labour of love for Oscar-winning actress Regina King, ""One Night in Miami"" is her film version of Kemp Powers' play about a night in which Malcom X, Mohammed Ali, (or Cassius Clay as he was back then), Sam Cooke and Jim Brown got together in a Miami hotel room discussing their lives as well as the struggle for civil rights. It's fiction, of course, and could have been painfully theatrical but King opens it up beautifully and draws superb performances from the whole cast with Leslie Odom Jr's Sam Cooke, (surely the Oscar is his to lose) and Aldis Hodge's Jim Brown the stand-outs.Indeed it's very much an actor's piece and if the ground covered has already been covered elsewhere, this is material well worth repeating and as a piece of history that might have happened but didn't it provides much to ponder over. It's also hugely entertaining, funny and whip-smart, and by the time we get around to Cooke's rendition of ""A Chage is Gonna Come"" there won't be a dry eye in the house."
"I don't really like these works, assumptions of what it would have been like if it had happened, but the type of film needed, to never forget how evil we can be, a heavy film, racism hurts, in the little unfortunate comments, in the acts, in the looks, but the debate / clash of Malcolm X vs Sam Cooke was worth it, it was reflective, about success and investment, pleasing the whites or making a profit through them, emblematic, excellent production of what may have been that illustrious night... Beautiful, sad and tragic..."
"An old school sit down drama where 4 actors battle it out for who has the best monologue and who can have the best reactions to said monologue? I'm in. But in all seriousness, there's something so impressive about the way Regina King directs this tight ""what if?"" drama about the possibility that Malcom X, JIm Brown, Muhammed Ali, and Sam Cooke all hung out and discussed life one night. No matter what really happened, this film happened, and it was fantastic.8.4/10."
"I'm really surprised by the relatively low ratings this movie gets on IMDb. I wonder what people expect nowadays from movies like this one? A movie based on a true story, but most of all an incredible story, very well written and directed by Francis Annan, clearly someone who knows how to build a tension with just minimalistic elements in the plot. I sat at the edge of my seat for some parts of this very enjoyable movie. The cast was also great, with a Daniel Radcliffe that proves again that he evolved from Harry Potter to an all round actor. He can play about anything and he did a great job again. To me Escape From Pretoria is definitely going to end in my top ten movies of this year. If you're a fan of escape movies then you surely won't be disappointed by this one. It belongs in the list of great prison escape movies, and it's based on true events what makes it always better. The negative critics on here have no clue about good movies, just ignore them and give this one a shot, you won't regret it."
"""Escape from Pretoria"" will never win any Oscars but this heartfelt, social-conscious thriller, based on a true story and set in a South Africa under Apartheid, is a lot better than I thought it was going to be. As the title tells us, it's an escape movie, (obviously), and by their very nature, escape movies usually make for good thrillers and this is no exception. It's very exciting while not afraid to show the horrors of the South African prison system at the same time.Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel Webber are the two young white members of the ANC imprisoned for distributing anti-government propoganda and Francis Annan's film is about how they escaped from Pretoria Prison. Ian Hart and Mark Leonard Winter are other prisoners in on the plan. It's a very compact little movie though it's unlikely to cause Bresson's ""A Man Escaped"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Papillion"" cause for concern. That said, this is still edge-of-the-seat stuff, very skillfully done, and the performances throughout are first-rate. In the end, you might just say, it does what it says on the tin."
I like the bit where they made all them keys out of wood.
"A solid prison escape movie that supplies plenty of suspenseful moments and a fresh escape plan you can easily get behind. I found that it at times had a creative use of cinematography, and the score was suitably disturbing, somewhat similar to Psycho. Daniel Radclifffe really dissapeared into this role too; I was impressed.The film isn't astonishing or anything, but it's a job well done considering it's the first film from the director. Worth the watch if you're looking for some more new releases."
"If a horror movie visualizes something that otherwise would not and cannot be seen, is it something you like? And I'm not talking monsters in particular. Rather something that Imdb itself reveals almost instantly under the title. Having said that, the visual treatment and the allegories are there and ripe for picking an depicting. Doesn't mean it will float your boat or that youl will like the movie, especially considering the slow pace.Having said all that and with 3 female leads, this can annoy some people for different reasons. It would be a shame though, because if you are in the right mindset, you will be scared, entertained and have some food for thought too. Great performances all along from everyone involved. Try to go with the slow flow to get the most of it"

"It can be way too pretentious and theatrical at times but Malcolm & Marie is still a really good drama that's funny, stylish and extremely intimate with some insightful things to say about the film industry. John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible with fantastic chemistry. Sam Levinson's direction is really good, it's beautifully filmed and well paced. The black and white aesthetic choice really works and the soundtrack is excellent."
"Really did the writer of this screenplay, and the director simply assume its audience would be cretins? The dialogue is so pretentious and artificial that it is cringeworthy throughout."
"While the script is rife with monologues and exhausting rants about politics, art, and criticism, Sam Levinson's 'Malcolm & Marie' has little meaningful to say about anything. The movie starts out solid on its first 20 minutes, but then the conversation and conflict between characters just go in circles for another hour and a half. The performances are compelling, the black and white cinematography is stunning, but nothing can save this movie from its terrible writing."
"Yes Day - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Instead of heartfelt realistic execution, the director went all Tiffany Haddish or Melissa McCarthy (in her husband's movies) on the idea. Unrealistic, loud and screaming or should I say screeching kids.Jennifer Garner was the only one kept me watching this till the end. She tried her best but the rest of the cast has no energy or charm to match her.The girl playing the eldest kid, Jenna Ortega's agent must be working extra hard getting her all The most Annoying Teen parts on Netflix. First in YOU season 2, then Babysitter 2 and now Yes Day. Playing same irritating hyped up kid who is too smart and grownup for her age etc etc. we get it, you got angst.Can't believe that a movie about hour and half can get soo tedious. Kids may enjoy but parents have to suffer."
"Yes day is a comedy family drama that shows what it will be like if parents were to allow their kids to have a day where they can't say no anything they ask, well of course there are some exception. This film looks nice, especially the suitably picturesque location work and the photography is never too drab or garish. The acting performance was pretty good; Jennifer Gardner was clearly having fun with her role as a strict yet lively mother of not one but three kids. Edgar Ramirez was also good as the passive yet loving father. The three Young actors also played their part well. The mother-daughter dynamic was the main conflict, and although it was unoriginal it played really well and helped maintain the film's emotional level. Furthermore, while the script is not always sharp enough and has moments where it is forced much of it is highly amusing and smart. It also didn't seem as cheesy or as sappy, or at least it didn't go too far on them, as other family drama films. Although the story is admittedly very predictable and has a lot of cliches, both deliberate choices with both being two things that the film is poking fun at, it for the last two acts is full of energy and charm."
Typical family movie with family values and lessons of life. Definitely worth the watch with younger children.
Kids fantasy transformed in a movie and I don't against the concept for relaxing once a while. But literally kids have judgement on what's right or can do? Really no! This movie tried to tell even a yes day could be a nightmare. I can't take it even when watch they behave in the movie.
"Super generic family comedy is super generic. Couple decent performances offset by some massive logic leaps I just wasn't willing to make. Don't let your kids watch this, it will give them way too many awful ideas. As an aside though? I love that this was a mixed heritage household and they never once made a thing out of it. Garner is obviously a white woman and she's married to a (what's the appropriate parlance these days? Is it latino? Latin? LatinX? My apologies if I get it wrong) Latin American man who speaks Spanish and English during the movie. In so many other movies they would've done a whole thing about that and I kind've love that this wasn't even mentioned, it just was what it was and that's awesome. Movie is still super generic but I dig that."
"Moxie nails it in so many different aspects.Firstly it has a fantastic plot. It is well thought out, well executed, well scripted, and just enjoyable to watch. It will make you angry and frustrated at the world but will ultimately leave you with hope and promise after building to a heartwarming ending. The comedy elements work, the romantic storyline feels relatively authentic by teen movie standards, and the feminist message is well executed and powerful.The characters were all well done. Some were a little over the top and on the nose and I think it would have been interesting to bring in a few more male characters to explore more subtle instances of sexism and micro aggressions, but this is a relatively small criticism all things considered. The cast were all pretty solid, particularly the central performance of Vivian.The direction from Amy Poehler was great, carrying a great tone and style throughout the film. I loved the soundtrack as well which I think always elevates a teen movie a little more.I had a great time watching this film and think it delivered on its purpose very well.Most definitely worth a watch!"
"Sadly, Poehler is perfect proof that just because someone has impeccable comic timing & style in front of the camera, that doesn't mean they can control it from behind the camera. This awkwardly directed & extremely predictable empowerment ""comedy"" will be meaningful to certain people, I have no doubt...especially young women. Unfortunately, the film's inability to choose a strong position about its protagonists (brave & important, or immature & silly?) makes it feel irresponsibly glib."

"I kept waiting for this movie to do something to distinguish itself. When it ended, I first thought that it was a bit too uneventful. But I think that was intentional. There isn't anything in this story that makes it feel like a movie script--no three act structure or big climax."
"You know that tingling feeling you get when you get a fright - a bit (I imagine) like getting a little electric shock? Well don't expect anything like that from this haunted house yarn. In this case, the malevolent spirit seems to have emigrated from Japan to wreak havoc on any who enter it's house. Andrea Riseborough is the new cop in town who sets about getting to the bottom of the mystery. It's not an awful film, it's just neither scary nor funny. It's great that movies like this continue to drive fans to see it at the cinema, and it doesn't drag - it's just a mediocre effort at best."
"This flick is just meant to be a light hearted screwball comedy and it certainly achieved that goal. The characters are indistructable as you will see during their life threatening escapades and they always come out like fresh roses.David Spade pulls off his subdued character 'Tim' perfectly. And Lauren Lapkus as 'Missy' is possitively creepy as Missy was supposed to be.A movie for 'fun to watch time', not a lmao time!"
"(Flash Review)Can a blind date that starts off as a catastrophe end up in true love? David Spade plays a middle age fellow who meets two women named Missy/Melissa, associates the wrong phone number with the wrong name in his phone. He thinks he is texting the hotter one to accompany him on a work vacation trip. When they meet up ON THE airplane, it is the weirdo Missy, from a bad blind date that shows up much to his shock and chagrin. Stuck now, he makes the best of it. She is super outgoing and he is not and she does many wild things around his coworkers. Will he find her actions irritating or will they eventually grow on him and help him break out of his more reserved shell? And what will happen with the hotter and more normal Missy? There are some funny jokes and scenarios and many of them hit; not all do. Lapkus steals the limelight from Spade as her character is supposed to. Overall, it is a better movie that Spade has been in for a with many solid chuckles to be had."
"How utterly refreshing to watch an animation that tells a good, solid, story with strong characterisations and a great vocal cast that is not, necessarily, designed to just maximise box office revenues. It's a relatively straightforward story of an hunter ""Goodfellowe"" who, along with his young daughter ""Robyn"" (Honor Kneafsey) is recruited to hunt down a pack of wolves near the town of Kilkenny, of whom the local populace are terrified. The wolves live in an ancient forest and are having to come to terms with the increased human intervention in their lives, and with their habitat - and when one of their number disappears, the young ""Mebh"" (Eva Whittaker) makes contact with the young ""Robyn"" and together, the two try to track down the missing wolf and to find some more peaceful way for humanity and their lupine adversaries to live in peace. The animation is simple, yet sophisticated - building on a rich vein of Celtic mythology and some age-old fears and stereotypes that still exist some 370 years after this enchanting mystery is set. The pace mixes the cerebral and the action, with plenty going on for both eye and brain to appreciate. Even Sean Bean (who's angularly featured image matches so well his usually wooden acting style) manages to inject some humanity into what is essential a very enjoyable story of live and let live..."
"I saw ""Wolfwalkers"", starring the voices of Honor Kneafsey-the A Christmas Prince movies, Miss You Already; Eva Whittaker-in her first theatrical movie; Sean Bean-Jupiter Ascending, Game of Thrones_tv and Simon McBurney-The Conjuring 2, Mission:Impossible_Rogue Nation.This is an animated movie about an Irish folk tale. In fact, this is the third of an Irish trilogy-each story is different so it's not just one long tale-with the other two being 'The Secret of Kells'_2009 & 'Song of the Sea'_2014. This one is about a hunter, Sean, and his daughter, Honor, that hunt a pack of wolves that are actually wolfwalkers-aka, werewolves-on the edge of their village. Honor is a young girl so she is still in training. Eva plays a wolfwalker that befriends Honor after having an awkward altercation with her in the woods. Simon is the village leader that wants to eliminate all the wolves completely because he considers them beasts of Satan. The art is a little different from what you usually get from Disney but it does kind of grow on you.It's rated ""PG"" for violence, peril, scary images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
"Many reviews focus On the visuals, and they are stunning. But the story is also immensely complex. With characters engaging in legitimate moral struggles and having to face the reality of their true motivations. Moving and thought-provoking, without the clip pop culture references."
"Wolfwalkers: Wolfwalkers are humans who live with wolves, when their spirits leave their bodies they transform into wolves - werewolves. Set in 1650 in Kilkenny, Ireland and the woods near the town. Cromwell has occupied the area and is having the trees cut back, the wolves attack the tree cutters but the wolfwalkers try to mediate. A tale of the daughter of an English wolf hunter meeting up with a girl who is a wolfwalker. A friendship develops to the background of the occupation and the war between wolves and mankind. Beautiful, imaginative animation, the den of the wolves in a cave has rocks engraved with runes and sun wheels. A film which operates at several levels but at all times is entertaining. Directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart from a screenplay by Will Collins. 8/10."

"When a space mission goes awry, the craft crash lands leaving only one survivor - the captain ""Konstantin Veshnaykov"" (Pyotr Fyodorov) who, on the face of it appears ok. The military authorities draft in accomplished psycho-analyst Tatyana Klimova"" (Oksana Akinshina) to give him the once over and she discovers he is harbouring a symbion that has a bit of a penchant for human flesh... I actually quite enjoyed this. It has an authentic, almost bakelite, style to it - and that helps sustain quite a suspenseful sci-fi drama with the odd twist in the tail - and an alien that is a little more creatively designed that the usual bug-eyed nonsense. There is an half-decent sense of jeopardy as the look of the film, too - dark and dingy - helps generate an extra bit of menace. Certainly, it is a cannibalisation of a great many films that have come before; but that doesn't make it awful - indeed, though basic in it's premiss, the production standards are quite high and it sends a salutary signal to Hollywood that their days of producing derivative, old hat, sci-fi will have to change if they want to keep ahead of the game..."
"Home invasion, but a different kind. And ""home"" being something different than what the original thought was behind the saying. Then again, while we have some cliches here, we also have certainly interesting characters. At least to a degree. Especially the female lead is very interesting (not just because of her looks), the way she acts and how she holds herself up against a male driven force.But later on in the movie she gets a bit two dimensional, almost irratically ""helpful"". While there is an explanation to that at the end of the movie (with a ""twist""), it does not warrant all the things she does. Good deeds never go unpunished? For whom you may ask ... and that would a valid question. But that is nitpicking and would be a bit of disservice to the movie. A movie that is visually also stunning (talking effects here) and does turn it up a notch when it comes to violence, so not for the faint of hearted. Science Fiction friends will love this ..."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Sputnik"" (2020) was a very good sci-fi movie. It reminded me heavily of ""Alien"" and ""Arrival"". Its like an ""Alien"" and ""Arrival"" smashed into one and also set in a different place then usual. The place and time is 1983 and its Soviet Union - setting of sci-fi movie you simply won't see anytime soon. And this movie kept my attention during its whole 1 h 50 min. Its not just a ""monster"" flick - like i said the whole wibe of this movie reminded me heavily of ""Arrival"" - you kinda feel that there is more to it then it shows. Acting by two leads Oksana Akinshina & Fedor Bondarchuk were amazing in my opinion. Music at the end was haunting and directing of the whole thing was the thing that kept it going.Overall, ""Sputnik"" is a very good sci-fi / horror gem set in a very unique place and time. It borrows heavily from two masterpieces - ""Alien"" and ""Arrival"" - its not as great as those for sure, but i really liked ""Sputnik"" on its own - and the ending was very haunting + soundtrack was superb."
"Sputnik: SF/Horror thriller. Echoes of Arrival as attempts are made to communicate with an Alien. This is a more vicious alien though who likes to chomp on humans, biting half their skulls off to obtain cortisol from their brains. The alien lives within a cosmonaut, emerging at night for brief periods. Set in Russia in 1983 the cosmonaut is confined at a special military base and a psychiatrist is recruited to assess the cosmonaut and to try to interface with the alien. Quite disturbing when the ET gets the munchies, some interesting plot twists. The symbiosis between alien and man is put across in a plausible manner and the creature itself is convincing. Directed by Egor Abramenko from a script by Oleg Malovichko and Andrei Zolotarev. On Netflix. 7/10."
Strange plot but really not a lot to it. And some poor script writing. Might want to take some Geography classes before you write the next one.4/10.
"This movie is the usual government propaganda for war and destruction. But hey, they happen to deliver some vaccines. And the usual soft irony: fighting fire with fire has become fighting technological progress and preach Primitivism in a Sci-Fi context."
"Some good action sequences including bots 'n' drones and stuff, the rest is okayish. Like some reviewer quoted Buddha: ""expectation is the root cause of sadness"", I would conclude, that if you have not much - and even better - no expectations you may kill some spare time but for certain you won't get something worth to remember. Outside the Wire is one of those mass products movie companies - here my theory - produce these days on assembly lines on full autopilot mode. The scripts of course are recycled, oops, written by some algorithms. Also I just wonder, do soldiers really talk all the time and that much?"
3 out of 5 stars.Outside the Wire is a fair science fiction film that has a similiar concept like films Chappie or Robocop. Where a society is crumpling. Androids are taking over as militarized soldiers. And cyborgs being created.The plot follows a soldier Harp (Damson Idris) who made an irrational call on a operation. He gets reassigned to Leo (Anthony Mackie) who is an android soldier. And going to travel in a demilitarized zone to go after a terrorist group who are after nuclear codes.The plot is forgettable. There is a twist that does not make it any better. But plays with a concept idea of kill millions to save a better future idea.The action sequences is pretty decent and entertaining for action fans. Anthony Mackie does kick a** as an android soldier. Facing against bad guys. And other militarized robots. The visual effects are decent.The script does make the characters feel bland. And the direction is a bit flat. Which does not make the movie stand out or different. It does have some exciting action but story and direction does make this one film forgettable once it is over.
"There is suspense and some mystery, but the ending doesn't answer any questions."
"The Ultimate Downfall and Devastation of this ""New"" Entry in Modern-Horror is that there is Nothing New.Every Slasher and Bad-House Cliche is Relied Upon.It Comes Off like Someone's Uninvited Cousin.What are You Doing Here?An ""Oh So Familiar"" Story with Virtually No Twists, No Surprises, and Borrows Heavily on its Betters.A Lackluster Affair with Competent Acting, but the Story is so Lame it Feels Rusty from the Get-Go.The First-Half Absolutely Nothing Happens except some Cheating by one of the Couples.The Second-Half, the Dog Goes Missing. That's a Highlight.None of the Characters are that Interesting and some are Unlikable. No One Really Stands-Out. Their All just Inert, Opportunistic, and Soul-Less.The Ending is Confusing After it Ends.Nothing to Recommend to Anyone but Horror Completest.Not Worth a Watch for Anybody Else."
"Charlie (Dan Stevens), his girlfriend Michelle (Alison Brie), his volatile younger brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh's girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand) have rented an ocean-side house for vacation. The owner Taylor (Toby Huss) may be a racist. When Josh's dog goes missing, he suspects Taylor. A camera is discovered in the shower. It culminates in a violent confrontation.This is an indie horror directed by Dave Franco. The story is fine for a striped down horror. I would let Josh kill the man rather than engineer the death. It's meant to alleviate the guilt from him when that's not really necessary. Nobody likes him in the first place. It works a lot better if the extra element is kept off screen for awhile longer. Let the four characters cook in their own juices. The bubbling relationship between these four is the best aspect of this movie.The movie's main difficulty lies in its director. Franco lacks the specific horror action skills. Non of the kills are exciting. The horror could be much scarier. Running at the car window is probably the only good horror shot and that scene is cut short. The body on the cliff would be terrific visual if Franco could incorporate more vertigo into the shots. If you're crashing a car anyways, let's flip it for more exciting crash action. Franco doesn't have the required skills to elevate the horror thriller aspect."
"I liked this, having found many horrors in the slasher/mystery genre pretty disappointing in recent times, this was pretty decent. It's definitely flawed, so don't expect masses of tension, or any scares, but overall, it's solid.The one criticism I'd have, is that it's so slow to open up, that's the major issue with this film, you're waiting for an hour for the fun to start. The last half hour of the film is the best part, it is really good, and surprising.There are a few twists, and it does a god job at misdirecting you, a second would definitely work.I have to say though, Dan Stevens, is this really what you're going to be doing from now on in? You're better than this.Check out the actor under that mask, Anthony Molinari, a shame that face was hidden away for so long.If you enjoyed The Strangers, I think you may enjoy this.Pretty good overall, 7/10."
"It has good production, but I can't relate to the story. The fairy creatures are not so pleasing too look at either. Can't say I enjoyed it."
"Watching Artemis Fowl is like listening to someone read a complicated instruction manual at a very quick pace, without pausing to allow for questions or reflection. I get that they had to cram a lot of story into one 90-minute movie, but it just doesn't make any sense. Artemis is unlikeable, Mulch Diggums is annoying, I felt embarrassed for Dame Judi Dench, and the rest of the cast is forgettable. If you're interested in this story, skip the movie and read the books."
"Writer Eoin Colfer noted some years ago that the film version of his Artemis Fowl books has been stuck in development hell. The producers even a cast a young boy as Artemis Fowl, a role he never got to play. Colfer said he still sees him around and he is now a grown man.Disney hired Kenneth Branagh as director to bring the film to the big screen. After all he appeared as a villain in one of the Harry Potter films and directed the first Thor movie for Marvel. Instead the film has gone to Disney' streaming channel.Young Artemis Fowl is a 12-year-old Irish genius who needs to rescue his father who has been taken by a fairy. His wealthy father has been accused of stealing artefacts and the fairy wants to recover the precious Aculos.With the help of bodyguard Domovoi Butler, a dwarf and a fairy. Artemis Fowl goes off to rescue his father and comes across a magical city of fairies, trolls and dwarves.This is a fast moving action film, with good special effects but it is also rather sloppy and haphazard. I sense Branagh's finished version was gutted by the producers.Having its theatrical release delayed and then dropped in a streaming service, I doubt this will become the next Harry Potter franchise."
"Now I am not familiar with the novel/source of this and when or how this was created. What I do know is that it does try hard to encapsulate and ""rip off"" Harry Potter and live off of that success. Now fair to say and as you can tell by the rating at the moment (which I matched), that most think they did not meet that standard by a longshot.Having said, the cast is not bad at all. The special effects are fine. So I can also understand those who maybe because they already heard so much bad things about this, went with lower expectations and actually liked this. But the cocky teenager that is fron and center here does not bode well, even if he has some good points he's making. So I don't think there's more to be said ... except that it looks unlikely this will get any follow ups soon ... (and watch the pitch meeting on Youtube which is as all their other Meetings super funny)"
"Man, this movie is as scary and compelling as could be. In a display of the utter helplessness of the people who get caught in the middle of political warfare, Quo Vadis, Aida? Presents the despair and determination of one woman's struggle to keep her family safe by any means necessary.It's a heartbreaking movie, truly... And one that makes us appreciate the freedom from conflict and war we enjoy. Because the moment war is something you have to worry about, then you know your life is as disposable as the others to those in charge."
"It's hard not to be reminded of Schindler's List while watching this. That comparison doesn't help this movie, which can only pale comparatively (particularly in the filmmaking technique and style), but that doesn't preclude this movie from be effectively harrowing. When faced with an insurmountable, inconceivably inhuman tragedy, we are left with nothing but the desire to maintain as much of our life as we can, and Duricic carries that burden with immense power."
"This film was much needed on the quarter-century anniversary of the massacre of Srebrenica, one of the most bloody pages of the most recent european wars, the Jugloslavian conflicts, that happened so recently yet are unspoken of.Zbanic's film is better described as a family drama that happens to be set during Srebrenica than a film about Srebrenica alone. Or better, it is a film that is able to portray the events of Srebrenica yet focus on the personal story of a handful of characters.The main character, Aida, is an interpreter for the UN military unit that was sent to Srebrenica in 1995, and is determined to save his all-male family from the butchery of their invaders. Her character is the center of virtually everything that is depicted, and allows to give a wide glimpse at the most recent genocide occured on european soil. While several of the main characters are invented, they interact at various points with really existing people: Mladic, the ""butcher of Bosnia"", colonel Karremans of the UN military division, among others.One element which I found relevant was how the film underlined the fact that the post-jugoslavian conflicts were a conflict between neighbours, between people who belonged to the same communities, and the epilogue depicts this in a most shocking way."
"Powerful story told very well. The emotion was just amazing. I knew nothing about the real world events that this film is based on, and I feel like that's a problem. A lot more people should know this story. This is a difficult watch that is bolstered by top tier filmmaking and acting. Overall, I thought this was a great film. It's a very important story told very well, and it definitely deserved its Oscar nomination."
"Balram (Adarsh Gourav ) climbs from village rock breaker to owning his own company, working primarily as a driver for a rich man. He does enough asides as he spouts his socialist message that excludes whites. Not as entertaining as ""Slumdog Millionaire"" nor is there any dancing. Well done but a slow moving Horatio Alger story. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"""The White Tiger"" is the antidote to ""Slumdog Millionaire."" The latter film feels like a bunch of white guys appropriating Indian culture to tell their version of a fairy tale. ""The White Tiger,"" by contrast, feels like a movie about India made by people who understand India.It's an energetic, exuberant movie about the desperation that drives a poor ambitious man from a small village to murder and eventually a life of wealth and privilege. It's a dog eat dog story, almost literal in its telling and lacking any nuance, but pretty entertaining. It also feels very familiar to those of us living in places like the United States, where the lip service given to words like democracy, freedom, and capitalism are belied by the reality of those who have trampling over those who have not in the race to get even more.I enjoyed the glimpses of modern-day India that this movie offered, even if they convinced me it's not a place I'm in any hurry to visit soon.Grade: A-"
"It's gross, rude and crude. It is not the kind of humour I like. Someone will like it, bit not me."
3/10 - this unbelievable Borat knockoff is frustrating (can we give Tiffany Haddish a role that isn't so stereotypical and tired?!) and remarkably unfunny (especially given the cast involved)
"Comic film that manages to give prestige to a not particularly imaginative but particularly amusing comedy. The whole movie makes you laugh and entertain a lot, a really good comedy movie to watch with friends."
Some over the top moments where you will laugh out loud but with the Jackass style and having a story it just did not flow right.
"This film has lots of talking, and little singing. It is about the band, and not Ma Rainey. It is not what I was expecting. I honestly found it boring."
Good movie to watch for the performance from tapsee and vikrant the movie has great music but it is not a suspense movie to deal the movie is clean and clear.
The cast was brilliant and there were lot of plot twists in this movie. A good drama plus thriller. A decent movie . Ending was good too. Lots of emotions and heartbreaks are there too.
The writer should make Rom-Coms or full on comedy entertainers. Crime thrillers are not her forte.The plot stands on the lousy Forensic work or the non existence of it.The jokes were so good though. I laughed a lot. It can be good if you don't look for logic.
"This is one insane Bollywood thriller - you'll might love the movie after seeing the unexpected finale. The film is enjoyable to see for its clever use of 135 minutes to blend suspense with sarcastic humour.There are actually three winners in the movie. Apart from Taapsee Pannu's powerful performance and Vikrant Massey's brilliance, there is Kanika Dhillon's writing which is very brilliant.Yes, there are flaws in the script and the story but despite its flaws, ""Haseen Dillruba"" is a pleasant watch."
Story isn't awful but it's lengthy. It could be due to the 3 or 4 music video montages. It seems that a lot of Bollywood films have these montages but I'm not used to them. I liked it regardless.
"Everythiing in america is big, the slogan has flashed over us for nearly 200 years, and this pickeled time traveller really grasps the big apple head on.its a witty, and actually quite funny look at how the american world have changed for a methusaleh aged eastern jew, they have made great vfx and done a pretty good research on product development, i remember the first time i used the seltzer water machine myself , a prototype soda stream 1980 model, and how my finger and body waited for the snarling stuttering puffs when the machine hgad done it ready, shock and awe, made in america.its pretty well acted, the jokes hangs really loose, the irony at its best and the opening section really shuffles the way open into maybe the comedy of the year.the grumpy old man, not a seth rogen fan usually, opens up his doors for more of this neolittic fus farsing. its well worth a watch. a recommend"
"An American Pickle was a Seth Rogen comedy that was actually in some ways funny and it had a interesting idea and premise about it,we also know how in some films idea like this one easily fails expecely when a actor plays a two roles and they are very similiar to each other,but here Seth was able to pull it off and he give one of his best performances and he was funny in some scenes,script was also solid but it had some very poorly written lines and a predictable moments in it,An American Pickle was a watchable film,it is also one of better Seth Rogen films and i would say that you should watch a film just because of his presance"
"Its basic virtue is the large freedom proposed to viewer. The liberty to chose the fair perspective, from nice comedy, clash between generation, best performance of Seth Rogen, decent descending in Jew tradition, sentimental portrait of a life face to new challenges, the life lesson, the nostalgia about lost worlds and irony about present one, the old influence of Hibernatus by Edouard Molinaro . So, generosity as the precious gift ."
"Once upon a time there was a little girl with a famous dad who made a decent film with very big movie stars that name droppers and sycophants praised to the heavens. Daddy after all was being ballyhooed for the overlong and execrable GF 3 so why not the kid? Did the US finally have its answer for Leni Riefenstahl? Nope. Seventeen years later the well budgeted banal filmography says otherwise as she returns to the crutch (Bill Murray) that started the rumor around her ""talent."" It's a sorry full circle with Murray continuing the career deadpan unabated and Rashida Jones ably subbing for Scarlett in auteur Coppola's ongoing investigation into the older male, younger female dynamic. Murray does his aging best to keep things buoyant but as in previous works (Somewhere being the best example) Sofia's tedious buzz killer deadpan ambience brings on the disinterest in no time and the girl that would be Leni is once again minor Nora Ephron without the funny bone."
"I didn't even know Coppola directed this when I started watching it. I selected it from one of my online subscriptions only because Murray was in it.Twenty minutes into it I was totally uninterested in Dean, Laura's hubby, alleged infidelity and Laura's boring and stressing life as an upper class NewYorker with two young kids.Enters Murray, as Felix, Laura's eccentric father, bringing some sparkles to the stale story. Yes, Felix is a womaniser but he's also charming and sophisticated and basically the only interesting character of the whole movie.Felix forces Laura to go into a private investigation on Dean and the two share some bizarre conversations about the eternal male-female struggle.Half way through, I got a hunch of how this was going to end and caught the bull's eye, so I lost interest because the whole chase is just an excuse to debate trite issues about relationships, with a politically correct twist.On the positive side, the photography is nice, with some beautiful settings but that's all and even Murray cannot save this boring and predictable truckload of cliches.It is now final: Sofia Coppola has nothing left say. She's even started pilfering from Bridget Jones' story line..."
"I guess many Apple viewers were suspecting to see a straightforward, simple and funny comedy, which it isnt. So beware, this movie is only suited for the art house movie fans of subtle character portraits.The good: Bill Murray, Bill Murray, Bill Murray.Any bad? Director Sophia Coppola has got a slowburning and mellow kind of directing, which many apperently find quite a bit boring, judging by the many other negative reviews. I love this particularly slow and mellow directing style though, because it gives the characters in this story room to breath and be real persons. So many comedies are only eager to score with making blunt jokes, but this is more of a subtle melancholic comedy/portrait, with real persons, with real life insecurities. Perhaps better suited for an older, middle aged audience?The story: a portrait of a married woman, stuck in a rut, who is doubting if her husband is having an affair. Her (hilarious) dad, played terrifically by Bill Murray, starts acting like a private investigator, following the whereabouts of her suspiciously acting husband. Did he cheat or didnt he?"
"""Laura never stands a chance to better herself as an independent individual, in the end, she is just passed from one man to another, with the symbolic watch switch, that message doesn't quite swim with our current tide of woman-empowerment. Sofia, being a female and a member of the Coppola Dynasty, has been wearing a Teflon armor for too long, and the ""father issue"" she tries to come to terms with is more personal and regressive than we can give its credits for. Since many other budding women directors are finally thick on the ground, perhaps it is high time that we look elsewhere for the next auteur-to-be from the distaff side.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
Da 5 Bloods (3.5 out of 5 stars).Da 5 Bloods is a pretty fair war drama film. About foue Vietnam vets that go back to the jungle in modern time to search for their best friend remains while searching for hidden treasure they buried.The plot is good also focusing on modern times of race and black lives matter concept. The film also shows the struggle each vet is going through mentally and physically. Delroy Lindo delivers a powerful performance that he is struggling with. The cast is good with there performances.The film does have a sense of style with Spike Lees direction with the narrative switching between Vietnam war to present day. I did not think this was Spike Lees best movie. But it was entertaining. I did have issues with how long the movie was. It was overlong and needed some editing to help with the pacing.
"""Da 5 Bloods"" is a Drama - Adventure movie in which we watch five veterans returning to Vietnam in order to find and retrieve the remains of their fallen squad leader. They will also search for a gold they hid there when they were fighting.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot with plenty of action and suspense. The direction which was made by Spike Lee was very good and I believe that he did a great job on combining some dramatic moments with action. He also did something that I have not watched in any other movie, he kept the same actors to play in some flashbacks without making them look younger, something that I found very interesting and new. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that I enjoyed very much the interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as Stormin' Norman and it was one of his last interpretations. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Clarke Peters' who played as Otis, Delroy Lindo's who played as Paul and Isiah Whitlock Jr. who played as Melvin. Finally, I have to say that ""Da 5 Bloods"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that everyone could gain something by watching it."
"Pretty typical and brings nothing new to these sorta films, but it still has more to it than I was expecting.I had predicted it was going to be a full-on forced comedy and cringe teen romance, but it actually has a little bit more substance to it. Added to the fact that none of the cast irritated or annoyed me, which is always a positive. You can guess what's coming up from minute one, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it - albeit to a minor degree.Aimee Teegarden (Nova) and Thomas McDonell (Jesse) are a decent enough pairing, while the characters of Danielle Campbell (Simone) and Joe Adler (Rolo) are more interesting than they seemed to be early on. Dean Norris, midway through 'Breaking Bad' at this point in his career, also appears.'Prom' may have absolutely nothing special about it and is very plain, but I'd very much be lying if I said I disliked it to be honest. It's passable."
"I was a bit hesitant in liking this in the beginning, but definitely warmed up towards the middle. This reads very much like a Broadway musical, snappy tunes and message heavy. Fairly like-able, fun teen lead, adults were okay."
"This film is so beautiful. The sets, the songs and the message are all so beautiful. I was so touched. I even watched the credits because I didn't want it to end."
"""The Prom"" is a Drama - Musical movie in which we watch two self-obsessed theater stars trying to help a high-school girl going with her girlfriend to the prom. They have to change their behaviors and truly help the girl if they want to change as persons.I liked this movie because it presented very well a serious social topic from different perspectives while it consisted of some sarcastic scenes about celebrities and famous people in general. The interpretations of both Meryl Streep who played as Dee Dee Allen and James Corden who played as Barry Glickman were very good and they both did a very good job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jo Ellen Pellman's who played as Emma Nolan and Keegan-Michael Key's who played as Principal Tom Hawkins and they were equally good. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Prom"" was not exactly what I was expecting but I have to admit that was good and I recommend everyone to watch it."
"Dave Bautista is stuck in a rut they keep giving him or hes taking roles that are all the same ....action comedies and with the exception of guardians they are not good!! This was worse than stuber but the same crap, poor dialogue, ok acting, bad action sequences, just a bad movie. Had maybe 2 good lines it wasn't worth watching although it was free on Amazon."
My Spy (3 out of 5 stars).My Spy is a fair action comedy film about a CIA agent JJ (Dave Bautista) who surveillance on a lady and her daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman). Until Sophie catches them and blackmails JJ to help train her to be like him.It is a cute fun story. But the story is predictable. The film begins with JJ undercover with a Russian mob in a warehouse that ends in a firefight and chases. JJ is awkward when it comes to being a people person. He attains Sophie bring a parent or friend to school. Going on ice skating. And falling for her mother.It can be cheesy. The action sequences is decent. It does have its fair share of laughs. Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman are both good and charming with there characters.
"A cute action comedy that hit all the notes. The cast had great chemistry and the comedy landed. The storyline was fairly predictable, but it didn't need to be more than it was. Truly enjoyable."
"Dave Bautista is stuck in a rut they keep giving him or hes taking roles that are all the same ....action comedies and with the exception of guardians they are not good!! This was worse than stuber but the same crap, poor dialogue, ok acting, bad action sequences, just a bad movie. Had maybe 2 good lines it wasn't worth watching although it was free on Amazon."
"I was looking forward to seeing this movie in theatres. Becoming a huge fan of Dave Bautista, The actor so I actually could not wait to see this family friendly picture.
It seems almost mandatory that a ex-wrestler needs to star in a family friendly movie , especially if Bautista wants an acting career as big as the Rock (who did Tooth Fairy) John Cena (Who just did Paying with Fire) or dare I say it...Hulk Hogan (Every movie he ever starred in).I won't spoiled the movie for you, because I don't have to. We've all seen this movie so many times that you already know the Spoiler Alert just by watching the trailer.Typical tough-as-nails action hero type being soften by his awkward interaction with a smart aleck little girl (it usually is a girl).I will say that Bautista does bring his own flavor to the formula and despite telling the same jokes over and over again, he's not bland. Plus his chemistry with the little girl is good. Makes it a feel good movie.It's also a fun movie. Lots of laughs and very exciting, just like a wrestling match, so it works that one of the best wrestlers in the biz is the star of it."
"The Kissing Booth 2 had had plenty of ups and downs. First, Lee and Rachel. Their relationship was not what I expected after watching the first movie. I actually was extremely annoyed by her and thought she was trying to make him decide on his best friend or her.
Second, Elle and Noah. Their relationship was a mess but the chemistry was on point this time around. I felt myself liking them a lot more, which is funny since they broke up in real life when filming this. The whole situation with a Chloe and Marco was just a disaster and nothing is really explained. It definitely felt like something was missing. Noah's facial expressions were not matching with what he was saying at all.
Third, Lee and Elle barely had any screen time together. I wanted to see more friendship moments with the two of them.
And lastly, I didn't feel it with the new cast. Marco and Elle I was just not liking at all. I mean clearly he was the better guy but I just didn't feel any chemistry. Chloe was flirting way too much with Noah. It was honestly disgusting.
Overall, I really enjoyed the real life situations being used on this movie."
"Somehow the first film was under my radar. Elle (Joey King ) spends the entire summer before her senior year in High School having premarital sex with her boyfriend Noah (Jacob Elordi ) before he leaves for Harvard. Elle then spends too much time with Lee (Joel Courtney) which causes drama with Lee's girlfriend, Noah has a hot female friend at Harvard which causes teen angst and Elle has a hot dance partner which upsets Noah. The drama was comical for a guy my age, but I am certain the teen ladies ate it up.Not for me. Let me know when Joey King gets her nose fixed."
The Kissing Booth 2 is the sequel to the 2018 romantic teen comedy starring Joey King and Jacob Eldoldl. Ellie and Nat have parted due to leaving for Harvard. Still missing him she goes to Boston to find him but when she does meet him she's convinced that Nat is cheating on her with another girl called Chloe. Meanwhile Ellie meets Marco and shares a bond with him.Will she break up with Nat or will she go with Marco.
Oh Why Sitting Through The First One Was Bad Enough Sitting Through This One Was Even Worse Flat Out Dumb
"This film start with a girl ""Elle"" talking about her boyfriend ""Noah"" left her to study, and she apply for the same university with her boyfriend's brother ""Lee"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Elle and Noah need to reconcile their relationship , after they mistaken both of them have affair with another person! Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, and overuse of the dancing on the dancing game machine scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Elle and Marco perform together at the dancing contest! At the end, Elle met Noah at the kissing booth and get back together! Elle have been accepted in both University Of California, and Harvard University application! Still have a series of bloopers scene alongside with the end credit scene! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
"Inspired by true events The Banker shows how in a not that distant past black people just didn't have the same rights and opportunies as white people. Nowadays there is some progress made even though there are still a lot of people that will judge people just by the color of their skin and that without knowing the person. There always will be people that base their judgement of somebody by the color of their skin, racism is for dumb people and dumb people we will always have. That said this story is worth to be told, and definitely helped in giving everybody, no matter what race or religion you belong to, a chance to have equal opportunities and rights to make money or to live where you want. Great job from Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Hoult and the rest of the cast, excellent acting from their part. George Nolfi made this movie most enjoyable to watch. The movie deserves a high rating and certainly doesn't deserve negative reviews."
"""The Banker"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the real story of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris, two African-American entrepreneurs who built their business empire by hiring a white man pretending to be the head of their businesses.I liked this movie very much because it was based on a simply amazing true story. The direction which was made by George Nolfi, it was very good and I liked very much that in the end of the movie showed us real photographs of the real people. The interpretations of both Samuel L. Jackson who played as Joe Morris and Anthony Mackie who played as Bernard Garrett were very good and I was really surprised by the interpretation of the last. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Nicholas Hoult's who played as Matt Steiner. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Banker"" is a nice movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it because everyone needs to know about this story."
"Based on a true story, ""The Banker"" is the interesting tale of achievement against great odds. Bernard Garrett is a young and ambitious black man in mid 20th-Century America. Intelligent and driven, he moves to Los Angeles and plans on succeeding in the real estate business. He meets Joe Morris, a successful local black businessman whose loquacious and flippant personality couldn't be more in contrast to Garrett's stiff and nerdy character. After facing inevitable resistance in getting started Garrett overcomes his intitial dislike of Morris and resumes communication with him. The two strike a deal of purchasing properties around the city and decide on using Matt Steiner, a white colleague of Garrett when the latter was working a menial job as a handyman as a front while calling the shots behind the scenes. Events go swimmingly well for the men as success and wealth are for them to be had. After a visit back home to Texas Garrett decides to buy the bank in his hometown. That's when things start to get interesting. Featuring good acting and an in depth glimpse into the banking world the movie is an effective observation and critique on history, finance, race, gender and friendship. Simple and watchable, ""The Banker"" is solid history and filmmaking that touches on timeless topics inherent in the human experience."
"The banker is a film that starts quality cast,mackie was always actor that was more for comedys and mcu guy,but here he give one very good performance maybe the best i seen him in,samuel l jackson was again enterteining and most fun to watch of all three actors,while hoult maybe overshadowed he still give solid performance,banker isnt special film by any means,it has stories that are been explored before and some of its repiptivnes was tiresome in scenes,but i can also say that this movie was good as its material was,and that is film biggest praise,if you watch you wont get something astonishing but you could still have good time"
It's a well played film of an interesting story of true events that kept my interest throughout
"High schooler Ellie Chu is a loner in the mostly white Squamish. She is the Chinese girl who gets derisively called Chu-Chu. She and her father run the local train stop. Her father is still depressed from the lost of her mother. She sells English papers to her classmates and has a crush on popular girl Aster Flores who is dating arrogant jock Trig Carson. One day, clueless jock Paul Munsky asks for help to write a love letter to Aster. She needs $50 to keep the lights on at home and agrees to write one letter.It's Cyrano de Bergerac with a gay twist. It is sincerely sweet and a terrific addition to the Netflix YA catalogue. All three leads are compelling and nice. One roots for these characters. I would push them together faster. First I would start the Ellie-Paul friendship sooner. I do have an issue with the Paul-Aster dates. She is cheating on Trig in a small town and she can't do it in public. The better way to do it is to make Ellie and Paul friends sooner. Aster would see it and use Ellie as a go-between. The side benefit is more sweet awkwardness between Ellie and Aster like the hot spring scene. Otherwise, the dates are good but they wouldn't actually happen. In the end, this could be seen as overly sweet but there is enough sincerity for the most cynical amongst us."
"""The Half of It"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a boy trying to express his feelings to a girl with the help of another girl who is secretly in love with her. Everything becomes even more complicated when all their relationships reviled.I liked this movie because it was very different than the previous romantic movies that I have watched and it had some plot twists that I did not expect. I also believe that the direction which was made by Alice Wu who is also the writer, it was very good and she did a great job on it. The interpretations of both Leah Lewis who played as Ellie Chu and Alexxis Lemire who played as Aster Flores were simply amazing and in addition to the interpretation of Daniel Diemer who played as Paul Munsky which was equally good, made this movie very interesting and fun to watch. Lastly, I have to say that if you want a nice and funny movie to watch then you should definitely watch it."

"A mostly formulaic rom com is given a jolt of originality by recasting the Cyrano in this retelling of the Cyrano de Bergerac story as a young Chinese-American woman awakening to the fact that she is a lesbian.This movie is likable and watchable, if not addictively so. Much of it is breezy, while little of it is confidently funny. Some of the jokes land, some don't. But's it's sweet and positive in its messaging, and sweetness and positivity are welcome qualities in entertainment these days, when both are in short supply pretty much everywhere else.Exactly the kind of made-for-Netflix movie you would expect it to be.Grade: B"
"There's a great movie inside of The Half of It, and Wu is a tremendous talent who shouldn't have to wait 15 years to make another feature film. Like too many Netflix movies, this one feels like the script needed a few more drafts."
"I've seen this movie because of its controversy, wanted to see if it's really as shocking as everyone says. I don't know, maybe I grew up in Indonesia's culture, so it's so provocative for me. Good coming of age story, but no matter the ""message"" of a story, for sexualizing children (even in acting) is wrong, but it's 2020 after all."
"The story is the story of the mother, not the daughter. Yet, at a certain point somebody decided that sexing up very young women would make it a way better movie. I simply don't get French cinematography in the last two decades. So many movies who lack a plot, but are very concerned with the sex lives of people 6 to 16.As for empowering women, this is the precise opposite. It simply plays the role of the abusive old woman who would cut the clitoris off the young woman if she were from East Africa instead of West Africa. It is about keeping women in their place, obedient and voila! you get bliss."
"I knew nothing about this film before watching it except that it sexualised children. However I wanted to know what the hulla baloo was about because Hollywood has been sexualising them for years.
As it turns out i think this is a fantastic film with a really strong message that the overly dramatic and faux moralistic brigade will have missed because they don't think further than a Sun headline.
I could talk all night about how this film simply shows in very clear terms what society is doing to our kids, but the ones who need to listen won't.
If you want this type of film, which reflects real life, to stop, then stop Rihanna who's very highly sexualised moves has inspired young pre teen girls for years. Stop Rihanna, stop Miley Cyrus, stop all of the people who basically sell their sex and inspire ever younger children to emulate them.
This film does not sexualise young girls, it shows how the world is sexualising pre teens. If you want to find fault find fault there."

"So, they jump into some unarmed vehicles is a war zone and go for a drivd, no planning or anything.. it's down hill from there. It's a shame, it had the potential to be a good movie with a few decent actors."
"Anyone who rates this 10 Stars is clearly either IN the movie, WORKING for the movie or a complete idiot.There are so many plot screw-ups in this movie, I really don't even know where to begin. The story is dumb. The outcome is predictable. The acting is boring. The fight sequences are so slow and rehearsed as to remind of ""backyard wrestling"" with 15 year old kids.If you have NOTHING else to watch,... then maybe watch this, but otherwise, save yourself the frustration.4 stars,........... and that is GENEROUS."
"Let's not beat around the bush, this movie was ordinary - and I'm being nice. It didn't even have glimpses of brilliance. It was let down by bad direction, and bad acting by many of the cast. Though Brice Bexter did a good job for his character, it still wasn't enough to bring some quality to the movie.Apart from bad directing, it needed a solid script, and the editing could do some work. Plus the action sequences, where appalling. It never gave me a sense of danger nor stress in the situation the main characters were in. It failed to convey the uncertainty and the horrors of being in a fire fight in close quarters. The Rambo movies were more realistic compared to what this movie could muster. And Rambo movies were not that realistic.Too many flaws in the movie to mention, but you get the picture.VERDICT: Watch it if there isn't anything else available. Or maybe just take a nap instead."
"This film is terrible, really bad, yet it has the majority of voters giving it 10/10??? It's obvious that they are manufactured reviews when you watch it, it's just painfully bad."
"I was waiting for something to happen and when it eventually did, I wish I hadn't bothered. Avoid this movie at all costs. Tragic to see Andy Garcia put his name to this turkey!"
"This film start with the main female character ""Lara"" writing letter to her boyfriend ""Peter"", and she talking about her trip at Korea scene! As turnout, this film is about Lara , and Peter need to separate four years apart, because of their different place of study! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the dancing scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the taking picture scene, overuse of the texting scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, overuse of the kissing scene, and overuse of the calling names scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Lara signing the so called ""New Contract"" prepare by Peter! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
Too sweet and teen for this one. I keep my patience to watch this for 30 minutes and can't last til the end. The background just sooo sweet and girly which I'm not the target audience. But the quality of this upholds certain movie standards and can tell it's well planned.
"What a beautiful song to conclude this sweet series adapted from the YA novels by Jenny Han ""To All The Boys I've Loved Before"". While not as strong as the first movie, this third and final film in the trilogy was better than the second film. There were some great Seoul travel shots and some wonderful shots of New York City...but ultimately this was the final entry in Peter and Lara Jean's romantic love story that started with a bunch of love letters and a fake relationship...and is concluded in this film which starts with The Covey (Lara Jean's) Family in Seoul, Korea for spring break. The big highlights in the film are the senior trip to New York, finding out about college acceptance, the prom, Dr. Covey's wedding, and graduation. This film is like a post card for high school romance and doesn't delve too deep into any heavy topics, although they do make an attempt to heal Peter's relationship with his father and touch on the Covey family grief in regards to their mom.Sweet, good hearted escapism and perfect Valentine's tribute!"

Long amd drawn out very very boring one and 2 are better 3 felt idk rushed
"Bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend unless you just LOVED the original.If you loved Kurt Russell and the Elves, then you're in luck, because there is a LOT of them in this. It's literally my 2 least favorite things from the first movie.Fighting for attention, is Darby Camp and Jahzir Bruno (the two should have been the focus of the movie), and Julian Dennison (Fire Fist, from ""Deadpool 2"") as Belsnickel.....a Christmas character I only know from ""The Office"", and it was not a great character.Honestly, it's like they watched the original and were pissed Kurt Russell was outshined by a child and they determined not to allow it to happen again.All the charm and child-like wonder that makes Christmas movies special is drowned in weird action sequences and a very grumpy Kiwi."
"Watched the first one last year and di watch this with the family on Christmas Day itself. Very entertaining and again with a bit of singing.Kurt Russel does wel as Father Christmas. Story is okay and funny now and then espescially with the trolls or elfs, call them what you want. Normally I'm not into all those Christmas flick, one happy family and peacufull world but none of that here. One adventure to save the town of Father Christmas.Yep, I liked it.
Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 3,5/5
Story 3/5
Comedy 1/5"
"It doesn't have the charm, magic, nor the charisma of the first, but it's cute and worth it for the tenderness of Christmas..."
"A benevolent superhero, a grounding sidekick, a villain who has a past with the hero, tons of neon-colored CGI, random time travel, a big colorful beam of MacGuffin power, and oodles of complex lore handled with little narrative interest. So it's a Marvel movie...a terrible Marvel movie. Still better than the first one though."
"The Christmas Chronicels Part 2 is the sequel to the 2018 movie from Netflix and it is directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone,Mrs Doubtfire). Starring real life couple Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell,the story is about Katie(Darby Camp) who is a cynic teen now,as her mom has moved on with a widow father(Tyrese Gibson from fast and furious) and his son Jack(Tyler Bruno from the witches remake). When a mysterious boy brings Katie and Jack back to the North Pole, they team up with Santa (Russell) and Mrs Clause(Hawn) to take down the mysterious boy who happens to be an elf who transformed into a human due to turning bad and he wants to take over the north pole.
Overall it's a good movie and if you liked the first one then do check this one out."

"The horrors depicted in this film must never be forgotten. The film is long overdue, and I am glad it was finally made."
"Some might find the level of cruelty displayed in this movie unrealistic even for a story about a genocide but historical records prove that deep indoctrination and conditioning is in fact capable of completely desensitizing human beings and turn them into cold killing machines.The main virtue of this movie is exactly that.That other than momentarily expressed nervous reflexes there is absolutely no hesitation, no remorse, no empathy displayed by the personnel running the camp.The lesson/warning/message : a process like this doesn't run its course overnight, let's all be vigilant and recognize the signs of something like this about to take place and stop it before it's too late."
"The horrors depicted in this film must never be forgotten. The film is long overdue, and I am glad it was finally made."
"The only good thing about this movie is that it had decent suspense and humour and acting was good enough.
Though it's not unique as many movies like this have been made earlier, showing 3-4 guys and their stories and how their stories cross meet in between. They just added the ludo game concept in their stories to make it look different."
"Hats off too Anurag basu for a great film. It has a great story with excellent screenplay which keeps you hooked. The performances of the entire cast is brilliant. And the direction is simply outstanding. This film has humor, action, romance everything. Definitely a must watch."
The acting and the storyline of this movie is just amazing. Bollywood need more movies like this kind of movie. I will recommand all of you watch this movie.

"""The Lovebirds"" is a Crime - Comedy movie in which we watch a couple getting into a murder mystery by mistake and the are trying to find out who is behind that murder. In the meantime they don't know what to do with their relationship because they think that is over.I found this movie interesting and funny, it is a good average movie to spend your time with. It has a simple plot but with some plot twists that makes it very interesting. The direction which was made by Michael Showalter was good with many nice scenes combined with action and comedy. Regarding the interpretations, I have to mention Issa Rae's interpretation who played as Leilani and she was simply hilarious, and Kumail Nanjiani's interpretation who played as Jibran and he was equally good and funny in many moments. Finally, I have to say that ""The Lovebirds"" is a good, funny and interesting movie to spend your time with."
This could have been a lot better but it some laughs. Mostly predicable but not the worst film out there. Just have low expectations.
"'The Lovebirds (2020)' is a perfectly fine comedy focused around a couple who are drawn into a vague criminal plot that may just be the key to saving their relationship. Needless to say, it's pretty generic. It's also rather unmemorable. The plot is almost as barebones as possible when it comes to its central mystery, which never really resolves - at least, not satisfyingly - and only serves to get the focal couple from set-piece to set-piece. However, some of those set-pieces are enjoyable and everything is competently constructed. The two leads do a decent job with the banter, bickering and obviously improvised observations that comprise most of the run-time. They're not the most charismatic duo but they're easy to root for and are affable enough, making decisions that mostly make sense in-the-moment and living in a relatively grounded world. The film is intermittently chuckle-worthy and it's breezy enough, to boot. It isn't all that atmospheric or compelling, but it's entertaining enough when it gets going. There's just about enough here to adequately pass the time; just don't expect to remember it in the morning. 6/10"
"This is a far fetched story, but it is funny. It delivers laughs."
"Relax and make you laugh at weekend is the objective of this movie. Just treat as comedy and enjoy, this did make me laugh."
I think Prabhudeva is in too hury to direct this movie I don't know what's the rush. The story of this movie is going on a speed that we can't even imagine I don't know what's the rush not even single scenerio is good. And the background music of this movie is so irritating that I could feel like my ears are gonna go deaf. In the name of Acting all the actors have done overacting. Only SONGS and the movie runtime is better than expected otherwise totally waste of time....
"Radhe was perhaps the worst decision to watch! The movie is a plain story with no turns or twist and just hyper elevate Salman Khan in a failed attempt
In most part of the movie, dialogues of Salman's other movies are used with additions of few more punch lines but it makes so much irritation to watch!This movie makes utter flop on box office on OTT."
"Prabhu Devaa who directed Wanted 2009 which was a remake of Telugu film Pokiri, for its sequel he remakes The Outlaws Korean film which was far better.The film adds all things that most Salman Khan films have like a forced romantic track, comedy and over the top stunts and result it's a messDirection is ok in parts but sucks overall
Music is ok, Zoom Zoom is best song, Dil De Diya is amazing, Seeth Maar is ok but Allu Arjuns version was far better and its placement could be betterSalman Khan does his part well though he has done such roles many times and it's time he changes his style
Disha Patani is for ornamental value
Jackie Shroff annoys in his role
Randeep Hooda excels while Sudhanshu Pandey has 2 scenes, Pravin Tarde leaves a mark
Siddharth Jadhav is wasted."
"What a ham movie can't even imagine that it could be so bad race 3 was better than this..I bet this time the fans will also not accept thisWhat a waste of randeep hooda and the quality of villains is also so poor like teasing girls jackie shroff is this the humour you offer us after being such a senior actor..dialogues will make you baffled..all the blames goes to prabhudeva he is taking undue advantage of we respected him for his danceRepeated scenes like give me miss call to get the number ,Radhe is only cop who can solve this ,drugs in the city are some of the loose scenes you will see ..mindless action like Radhe can beat any number and any size of people at a time followed by ham secenes like no body is powerful than Radhe and he is god for every oneLastly Salman was at his worst and Disha was for no useThanks that you made this blunder for 1 1/5 hour."
"Tone, Script & Story: The story is about brewing romance between couple who have witnessed cancer. First 70 percent highlights the young nature of romance full of masti. The next 30 the emotional side.I have seen the English version as well. The bollywood version fell short of 25 minutes. It created doubt. To add further we even have songs. But then trust me quality was not compromised.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The execution is precise. The couple along with other actors and filming locations look great.Music: The song maskhari is played along twice, the first time it hits the right notes. Second time however it is played when emotions run downside, trying to cheer. Overall even after coming from Rahman music was average.Acting: Sushant stood exception. All others were justified.Final Verdict: A story which promises balanced destiny and maybe a good afterlife if we see the bigger picture accompanied with faith. It's a top notch romance one must not miss."
"It's rather difficult to review Dil Bechara (My Helpless Heart) in the aftermath but from an objective view, it only manages to engage you with its fabulous music, the lively lead and supporting performances, and the camera work. It is evident that the film was bludgeoned in the editing to make it appropriate but it still retrieves the melodramatic pulp which will make it a much more emotional and touching watch for early millennials. For everyone else, it's touchy-feely with overenthusiastic characters working on a plot that has been said and told numerous times now. But still there's something delightful in Dil Bechara that reignites the magic of John Green's The Fault in Our Stars that the Hollywood adaptation lacked. TN."
"Even though the film's spirit and breezy pace triumphs, the melancholy that augurs it, will leave you in a puddle of emotions and with a heavy lump in your throat as the end credits roll. 'Dil Bechara' will always be remembered as Sushant Singh Rajput's swan song. Watch this movie simply to witness Sushant Singh Rajput's last act. A brilliant one at that."
No reviews for this one.. This movie will hold special place in our hearts forever. The everlasting smile of Sushant Singh and the energy he had in the movie. We will watch it again and again for Sushant.

I just don't understand y Netflix is targeting specific audience with this junk Instead try to give this audience what cinema is ........ crap/junk content movies like this
"I wasn't that much of a fan of the first movie but I still had hopes this for this movie. Whilst it isn't a bad movie, it definitely is a step down from the first movie.Unless you've escaped a mental asylum or on more drugs than all the riverdale writers put together, you shouldn't like the very uncharismatic Noah Centineo. He tries his best but he cones of so bland. He seriously effects the film and the chemistry with Lana Condor. Lana Condor is really great as is Jordan Fisher when they are on the screen, it becomes more investing.My issue is that Lana Condor was a refreshingly different character in the first movie but here she feels like the other movies, the first movie didn't try to be. That being the film is sweet enough despite being riddled with more cliches than your typical teen film. The ending however is a let down.That being said it is an enjoyable film which does have a lot of charm and heart but it just doesn't stand out that much. It is still worth watching and it's not exactly a bad film. I hope if they do a third movie I seriously hope it is better."
"Watched 3rd time after long gape.This is a best you could ever watch. Dream High untill you reach the Sky. Well Scripted and Executed. Director at her best. Suriya's acting is a Life time performance. Just Watch the Cult Classic movie. Its not a one time watchable movie, it has many details.One WORD. ""MASTERPIECE""."
"I watched this movie last night and was inspired by the theme: if you are willing to do something, your dedication will bend the fortune to fall at your feet. This movie is same: dedication, hard work, not to give up, and of course for a good cause. A person's dream to launch a low cost aviation turns true after a lot of turmoils and hiccups.Acting, screenplay, explainations, and continuation were all good and well done. Suirya's acting, by default, was again great.Now, when you create a movie you tend to put some masala, unnecessary churns, villainous events, and emotions; otherwise, how can you showcase it to the audience. The same falls for biopics. I will say for sure that this movie can't be 100% ture, but again, for me what valued most after watching it was inspiration and motivation. And off late, after watching pathetic biopics like Saina, i can definitely say that this one gets my hats off.A must watch."

Most pathetic movie. They have put the nation and armed forces to shame by making such a horrible movie. The script is all jumbled. CGI is poor. Direction is horrible and acting pathetic. The female spy is an epitome of overacting and all others are like stone. Avoid at all cost.
What a movie for us to feel patriotic on this Independence DayThe makers have really worked hard on this plot the director Abhishek has left no corner to cover about this sequence of warIt is shooted so widely with great VFX work you will feel as if you are seeing a Hollywood movie like top gun..the air fights are extremely mind blowing..the airbase and army base with the firings shown gives a thumping punch with background scoresAjay's voice gives a effect of a true brave soldier and he acted at his best with sanju baba and othersIt is far better than shershaah and offer our salute to our national hero's by watching this movie.
A good and different kind of plot with some new story. Yes there were some weak CGI scenes but atlast it's a good movie which you can watch with your family.
"What a hopeless movie, full of over acting. Doesn't deserve even two star. Any one enjoying such trash should be brave enough."
"Just enjoyed first 45 mins and Vijay sethupathi portions, without him Master is a waste of time! Nothing new to offer and to be entertained!"
"You know what to expect when you watch a Vijay movie. The only difference from the usual Vijay movies is the space given to Bhavani(Vijay Sethupathi).
I didn't have much expectations so the movie was not disappointing.
I felt like the script needed so much refinement.
First of all, they should stop treating Vijay as a superstar within the movie. He should play the character not Vijay. The choreography in dance numbers were really disappointing. I'm waiting(pun not intended) for a dance number like Ella Pugazhum. Andrea's character is an example of poor writing. They just placed the archery scene for the sake of that chase. It could've been executed better. And Gayathri should've been just another teacher who plays an important role in the plot. Making her fall in love with Vijay was really cringe. Songs were poorly placed. Especially Antha Kanna Pathakka. It interrupted the flow of the movie. I expected better action scenes too. Vijay is one of the best(and few) Indian actor who can easily handle action.
It's Vijay Sethupathi's Bhavani who steals the show. He's brilliant and terrifying villain who talks in a polite manner. The way he belittles the protagonist's emotions was really good. It's the long and nearly ridiculous scenes in the climax what kills the mood."

"RATED 6/10
Language: Hindi
Source: Amazon PrimeIf they advertised this as romance genre, may be they might have get more positive reviews...this is more of romance and less sports.If you exclude the exercising scenes, we can count the sports scenes...
The biggest problem in this sports movie is that villain... they didnt explain anything about villain other than ring commentaries...The villains are introduced at the ring only and their story ends in ring itself...
I really enjoyed the first half of the movie... after marriage, the movie goes into run of the mill story and nothing special..."

"The movie started with good energy but as the movie moved forward it was getting slow and boringNothing great act by farhan but miss Thakur was good same old concept of sports training and competitions..as it was a sports movie it should had electrifying content and story but this toofan did not had anything..the makers spoiled it by adding love story, unnecessary drama ,unwanted scenes,no good songs etcNo good content on this weekend too."
"Aktar is convincing as the rugged henchman turned into a boxer.His moves in the ring are genuine and he never fails to impress with his physical transformation.His talent as a subtle actor makes the already dramatic movie yet more realistic n he naturally blends the violent goon turned into a civilized boxer who is madly in love with his wife.This may be a movie about boxing but I was mostly in awe by the potrayal of the prejudices n biases against a particular community, most filmmakers n actors lacks the courage to show the harsh realities plaguing the diverse n amazing India.The movie has fascinating economic and cultural underpinnings.Director Rakesh Mehra continues to blow us away with his direction. The guy knows how to reinvent genres and do things in new and interesting ways.One repeated effect that I really enjoyed was the way the director handled the boxing choreography.Most of the reviewers who gave negative ratings n reviews are the fascist bigots who all are jealous.I am 101 percent sure that the fascist bigots who gave negative reviews and ratings are jealous cos they don't have good physiques, they have short and flaccid assets."
