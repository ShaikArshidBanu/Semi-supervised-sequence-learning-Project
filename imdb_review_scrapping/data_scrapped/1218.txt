["First of all, this movie series is not for those whose idea of love is like that which they see in disney movies. This film series shows a realistic portrayal of love. Even though I personally don't enjoy romantic movies, I had enjoyed the first movie because it is realistic.Now coming to this movie, it was ruined by overacting by almost everyone especially the main leads. As a direct sequel to After, this movie focuses on Tessa's job as an intern and how she deals with the revelation from the first movie. The poor plot and poor execution along with overacting are exactly what ruined the whole movie.Another thing I noticed is that a few characters from the previous movie were played by different actors. What's up with that? The director is also different."]
