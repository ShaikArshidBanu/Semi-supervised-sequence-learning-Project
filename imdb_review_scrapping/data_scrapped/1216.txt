['What a piece of garbage!\nMaybe if some pre-teen girls are gathered for a movie night together. Busy with their phones and tablets, so the movie dont interrupt them to much. This movie would maybe be somewhat okay....\nThe storyline is terrible, and the acting is non existing!\nThen she want, then she dont want, then she want, then she dont want and so on.... And the same for the "bad boy" who is just a total doll!\nI want you, now I dont want you, I want you, now I dont want you!\nOh my oh my oh my.....']
